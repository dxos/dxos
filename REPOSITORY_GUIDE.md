# DXOS Repository Guide

Instructions and documentation for developer workflows in this DXOS repository.

## Prerequisites

- Node v18.x (recommended: [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

## Monorepo workspace

This repository is a [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) and [`nx`](https://nx.dev/) monorepo with [`release-please`](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for release automation.

Get `pnpm`

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

Install at the repo root:

```
pnpm i
```

Build everything:

```
pnpm build
```

> Don't forget to install and build when switching branches

Run all unit tests

```
pnpm test
```

## Run commands:

Examples of ways to start up different workloads in dev mode:
| Command | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `pnpm nx serve halo` | Runs the `halo` app in dev mode |
| `pnpm nx serve-with-halo tasks-app` | Runs the `tasks-app` in dev mode pointing to a `halo-app` in dev mode next to it |
| `pnpm nx serve-with-halo composer-app` | Runs the `composer-app` in dev mode pointing to a `halo-app` in dev mode next to it |
| `pnpm nx serve docs` | Runs the `docs` vuepress app in dev mode |

## Adding new dependencies

Currently you must manually edit the individual `package.json` files to add packages. When adding a package name in `dependencies` or `devDependencies`, `vscode` should suggest package versions via autocomplete.

Once the required changes have been made, re-run `pnpm i`.

## Tasks in `nx` targets

Each package has a `project.json` which describes the "targets" or runnable actions/scripts that package can perform. There are also dependencies and caching information expressed such that performing any action will appropriately perform actions it depends on in the right order, cache-reading where possible.

For example, to run a particular app in dev mode, the target (action) is typically called `serve`:

```bash
pnpm nx serve halo-app
```

`nx` executes the target, and is aliased as an npm script `pnpm nx` (to avoid an unexpressed global dependency on an `nx` version). See [`nx run`](https://nx.dev/packages/nx/documents/run) for more syntax.

## Tasks in `scripts`

Packages may also declare scripts in their `package.json` `scripts` field as is traditional for an npm package. This is appropriate when `nx` caching is not suitable or necessary for the task, and when that script does not partake in the `nx` task dependency tree.

## Branches

In general, features are developed on feature branches starting with the author's nickname e.g.: `alice/some-feature`.

Features merge to `main` via PRs and checks like `pnpm test` and `pnpm lint` must pass.

PRs have to be [titled conventionally](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Chages to `main` trigger automatic deploys to the `dev` environment e.g.: `docs.dev.dxos.org`.

Periodically, release branches are created from `main` and merged to the production branches `production` or `staging` which causes deploys to those environments.

| branch       | purpose                                                                               |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `main`       | the only feature integration branch                                                   |
| `production` | reflects what code is in production (npm, docs sites, apps, etc) e.g. `docs.dxos.org` |
| `staging`    | reflects what code is in staging `docs.staging.dxos.org`                              |
| `release-*`  | release branches created from main and to merge with `production` or `stating`        |
| `hotfix-*`   | a hotfix branch created from `production` and destined for `production`               |

## Formatting and linting

Formatting is done by `prettier` and linting by `eslint`. Passing lint is required to merge to `main`.

Run `pnpm lint` to conform the entire repository with (equivalent of `lint --fix`).

Run `pnpm lint:changed` to lint only what you've been working on using `pnpm changed-packages`.

## Tips

### running scripts at the root

Most `nx` incantations assume you're at the root of the repository. They may not work if `cwd` is a nested folder. To force execution from the root while deeper in the repo, you can use `pnpm -w ...` such as `pnpm -w nx build tasks-app`.

### conflicts in `package-lock.yaml`

While rebasing, you can skip dealing with it during the rebase, just be sure to finalize with a `pnpm install` to regenerate the file at the end.

```
git checkout --ours pnpm-lock.yaml && git add pnpm-lock.yaml && git rebase --continue
```

finally

```
pnpm i
```

to regenerate the `pnpm-lock.yaml` on the new `HEAD`.

### Helpful aliases

```bash
alias px="pnpm -w nx"
```

More custom shell aliases can be included in your shell config via:

```bash
source $DXOS_ROOT/dxos/tools/zsh/tools-alias.zsh
```

### Storybook

```
Cannot GET /` when running 'pnpm run storybook'
```

Solution:

```bash
pnpm run storybook --no-manager-cache
```
