'@dxos/react-ui': patch

`Menu.Item`, `Menu.CheckboxItem` and `Menu.RadioItem` honour `closeOnSelect={false}`: a toggle keeps the menu open, as `onSelect` with `preventDefault()` already did. The Menu story renders every part (submenu, checkbox items, radio group, context trigger) and asserts them.

`Field.Switch` and `Field.Checkbox` pad themselves to the density's control height through their block margins, so a toggle takes a full row and sits centred in it, bare or beside its label; `Field.Block` sizes by the same token.
