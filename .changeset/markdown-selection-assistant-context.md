Replace `CommentConfig.getAnchorLabel` with a typename-keyed `AppCapabilities.AnchorResolver` capability; the assistant companion chat now includes the markdown editor's current selection as request context. Fix view-state persistence so a written value (e.g. a text selection) survives without a live subscriber instead of being garbage-collected back to its default.
