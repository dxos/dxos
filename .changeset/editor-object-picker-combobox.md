The editor's object picker is now a combobox: the query is typed into a search input in the popover instead of into the document, opted into per trigger via `searchTriggers`. In markdown, the picker sorts objects by name and leads with a generic "Add object" that opens the create-object dialog and inserts a link to whatever it creates. Links to internal objects no longer show a raw-URI hover tooltip.
