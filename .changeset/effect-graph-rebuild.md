Rebuilt `@dxos/graph` on Effect's `Graph` module and split the generic expansion engine out of the app graph builder.

`GraphModel` is now a long-lived Effect `MutableGraph` with granular per-node and per-edge atom views, `batch()` for single-notification mutation groups, incremental adjacency, `release(ids)` for unloading a subgraph outright (distinct from tombstoning `removeNode`), and opt-in `retainAtoms` that keeps each node's atom mounted for the life of the node. `ReadonlyGraphModel` and `ReactiveGraphModel` merge into `AbstractGraphModel`; constructors take an options bag.

`@dxos/graph/GraphBuilder` owns the extension registry, connector subscriptions, id qualification, ordering and dirty-flush over a `Store` port, with `ModelGraphBuilder` as the default specialization; `@dxos/app-graph`'s `AppGraphBuilder` specializes the same engine with app nodes, actions and URL bindings (`BuilderExtension.url` is now the generic `meta`). Node-id path helpers move to `@dxos/graph/GraphNode`. The app-graph namespaces are renamed to `AppGraph`/`AppGraphBuilder`/`AppGraphNode` and published as subpaths under those names; the old `NodeMatcher` splits, with the generic combinators in `@dxos/graph/GraphNodeMatcher` and the ECHO-aware ones in `@dxos/app-toolkit/AppNodeMatcher`. Writes read the model directly instead of atoms (a mid-flush atom read returns pre-flush state), flushes coalesce through `GraphModel.batch` rather than `Atom.batch` (whose deferred rebuild strands invalidations raised after its rebuild pass), and expansion, updates and removal are measured faster than before the rebuild across the board.
