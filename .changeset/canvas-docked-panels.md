`SceneView` docks its properties and layers panels by default: a column beside the canvas (which narrows rather than sitting under them) holding an accordion with one section per panel, any number open, the column scrolling them together. `SceneView.Root` takes `panels` (`PanelMode`: `'docked'` | `'floating'`) to float them back over the canvas instead; `Properties` and `LayersPanel` take `docked`. The layers toolbar's delete and merge actions move into a menu at its end. In Composer, a canvas drawing's menu offers "Dock panels" / "Float panels", stored as the canvas setting `dockPanels`.

In `@dxos/react-ui`, `Toolbar` adds no gap or inline padding of its own (its items carry their own spacing, and a `ToggleGroup` in a toolbar drops its gap to match), and an `Accordion` item's icon and caret sit in `Block`s rather than custom padding, and list rows in a container with no gutter lose their rounded corners. In `@dxos/react-ui-form`, a `Form.Viewport` without `scroll` pads its block axis as the scrolling one does, so a form in a host that scrolls it still ends a gutter in.
