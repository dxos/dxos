Fix comment author attribution and reset-device reload. `useIdentity` now seeds its atom with the service's synchronous snapshot so the current identity is available on the first render instead of a transient `undefined` — a comment sent in that window was stamped with an empty sender and never matched its author, hiding the edit affordance. During `client.reset()` the worker-reconnect handler now reloads to the origin (fresh boot) rather than the stale current route, and `Client.resetting` exposes that state. SQLite hypercore storage drains in-flight writes on `close()` so a save racing reset teardown can't stall or reject against a torn-down connection.
