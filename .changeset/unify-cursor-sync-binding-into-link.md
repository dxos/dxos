Introduce `@dxos/link`, a low-level infrastructure package holding a unified `Cursor` ECHO type (`org.dxos.type.cursor` 0.2.0), the relocated `AccessToken` type, and the durable-progress sync machinery. `Cursor` replaces `@dxos/plugin-connector`'s `SyncBinding` relation with a flat object whose discriminated `spec` covers both external-source sync (Gmail, Trello, GitHub, Linear, Slack, Discord, Bluesky) and internal feed-to-feed processing (e.g. mailbox fact extraction), so progress now persists across reloads for both. `Connection`/`Connector` stay in `@dxos/plugin-connector` and correlate to a `Cursor` via their shared `AccessToken` rather than a direct relation. This is a breaking change: existing `SyncBinding` relations and `Cursor` 0.1.0 objects are not migrated and are abandoned on upgrade — external syncs re-bind and feed-to-feed analysis restarts from the beginning.
