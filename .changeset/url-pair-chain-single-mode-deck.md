Redesign Composer URLs as pair chains (`/w/<workspace>/<key>/<id>/…`) resolved by the graph builder via per-extension `url: { key, kind, path }` declarations (replacing the `NavigationPathResolver` capability), and collapse the deck's layout modes into a single mode: presentation derives from plank count (fullbleed / tiling / sliding) and fullscreen is transient. Navigation is now gesture-based (no `navigationDefault` setting): nav-tree plain click navigates solo (shift adds a plank), and in-plank/card navigation follows the deck — adding beside the origin when sliding and replacing when solo. `LayoutOperation.Open`'s `disposition` values are `solo | add | auto`. Breaking: `LayoutOperation.SetLayoutMode` is removed, `?plank=` URLs are replaced by the pair-chain grammar, `AppCapabilities.NavigationTargetResolver` now declares its real requirement (`Effect<NavigationTarget[], never, Database.Service>`) so implementations no longer need a cast, and the unused `companionFrameSizing` field is dropped from the deck's persisted state (stripped by the existing migration).
