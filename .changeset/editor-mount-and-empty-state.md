A markdown field held open no longer paints an empty box before its editor arrives: the CodeMirror view is built in a layout effect, so a pane that switches subjects — a task's description beside its history — renders in one frame instead of dropping everything below the field by the editor's height a frame later.

Five hand-rolled empty states (no task selected, no task set, no sessions, no message selected, no result selected) now use `Banner.Empty` from `@dxos/react-ui`, so an empty pane reads the same everywhere and announces itself as a status.

`Empty` moves from `@dxos/react-ui-list` to `@dxos/react-ui` as `Banner.Empty`: it is the same statement a banner makes — a message in place of content — for the one case that carries no valence and paints no surface, and most of its callers are panes rather than lists. Every call site moves with it, and a package that depended on `react-ui-list` only to say "nothing selected" no longer does.

A task's history records what happened to the work — status, priority, estimate, assignment — and no longer narrates edits to its text. A title or description is edited by typing and commits on every blur, so logging those filled the history with "Description updated." and buried the entries a reader opens it for. The text is still written; it is simply not narrated, and a caller with something to say about such an edit still says it through `options.description`.
