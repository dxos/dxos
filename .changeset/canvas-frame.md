The scene shape is now a frame. Breaking: the built-in node type `scene` is renamed `frame` (palette name "Frame", shortcut F), with `PortalNode` → `FrameNode`, `isPortalNode` → `isFrameNode` and `PortalNodeView` → `FrameNodeView`; the node's `scene` field (its child scene id) is unchanged, and drawings saved with `type: 'scene'` are not migrated. A node type may define `hostOpen`, the host's own way to open a node of it: opening (double-click, Enter, the open control) calls it instead of drilling in, and auto-drill passes such a node by. A node type may also define `toolbar`, controls drawn above the node, flush with its right edge and at screen size, shown while the node is hovered or selected. The canvas clips rather than hides its overflow, so focusing an editor in a node no longer scrolls the canvas out from under the camera. A frame always draws its border, and one the host opens itself is never faded as the scene being zoomed into. A node's embedded content (marked `data-scene-overlay`) is live only while the node is active (`SceneViewAtoms.active`, `NodeViewProps.active`): a click on the node activates it, and selecting anything else or Escape deactivates it. Inactive, a press anywhere moves the node; active, a press on the content starts no move (so its controls receive their clicks), a double-click there does not open the node, and the wheel is the content's where it has something to scroll. Presses inside a portal the content opens (a menu) no longer reach the node.

In `@dxos/plugin-canvas`, a frame holds either its own nested scene or a referenced ECHO object: `CanvasSceneNode.drawing` is replaced by `CanvasFrameNode.object` (any object, picked in the properties panel) and `role` (`card`, `section` or `article`; unset is a card). A canvas drawing is embedded as a scene, as linked drawings were; any other object renders as its surface of that role, with a floating toolbar whose button opens the object in the app. Selecting the frame, or focusing within it, gives the object's surface attention, so its own toolbar acts. The object picker lists only user objects (those the navtree shows), not system objects such as space properties or canvases.

In `@dxos/react-ui-form`, the object picker's popup is as wide as its field rather than growing to its longest option.

In `@dxos/react-ui`, a `Card.Root` with `border={false}` also drops its corner radius, as its prop always described, so a card framed by its host shows no rounding of its own.
