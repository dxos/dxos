Extract the renderer-neutral scene DSL, dialects, layout engines, diagnostics and SVG content handler from `@dxos/plugin-illustrator/model` into the new `@dxos/diagram` package; the plugin's `model` entry now exports only the ECHO-bound builders (`makeBuilder`, `SvgBuilder`). The DSL gains arrow endpoint ports (`from`/`to` accept `object/element#port`, with `Scene.parseRef` / `Scene.resolveRef`), a `portal` element referencing a nested drawing, and an optional fractional `index` on world objects for z-order.

Add the scene engine (`@dxos/react-ui-canvas/scene`): an infinite, zoomable canvas of typed nodes (rectangle, ellipse, UML class, text, portal) and links (line, curve, spline) at multiple depths, with drill-in through portals, a projection seam for freehand, constrained and graph-driven layouts, in-place text editing, node styles, undo/redo, cut/copy/paste and a schema-driven properties panel. The private `@dxos/plugin-canvas` contributes it to the illustrator as the `dxos.org/scene/1` drawing variant.
