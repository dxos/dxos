MOSAIC ui-template groundwork across the UI packages.

- `Grid` layout primitive: track lists (`cols={['min-content', '1fr']}`), `subgrid`, `gap` from the spacing ramp, `align`/`center`, `contents`, and `asChild`.
- `Show`/`Switch` conditional-rendering primitives: `<Show when fallback>` renders its children (or a render prop receiving the narrowed value) while `when` is present — anything except `undefined`/`null`/`false` — and `<Switch.Root on fallback>` renders the first `<Switch.Match when>` whose `when` strictly equals (or, as a predicate, matches) `on`. Both are DOM-free and mirror the ui-template `show`/`fallback`/`switch`/`match` grammar.
- `Combobox`: the popover aligns exactly with its trigger (trigger-width content, zero collision padding), the trigger reuses the `Select` trigger slot and the placeholder role, and single-select lists emit one selection per press.
- `Listbox`: visible row focus ring, `onDeselect` (Escape clears only a non-empty selection), and a `multiselectable` mode for externally-managed selection with option navigation.
- `TaskList.Root`'s `onTaskCreate` now receives a `TaskDraft` (`{ title, ...optional patch fields }`) instead of a bare title, so a description (or priority/assignee) can be supplied when available.
