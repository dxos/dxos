Remove the legacy protobuf byte-transport client providers `fromSocket` (websocket) and `fromAgent` (unix socket), along with `AgentClientServiceProvider`, `FromAgentOptions`, and `getUnixSocket`. `createClientServices` no longer supports a `runtime.client.remote_source` endpoint — it now throws, since the remaining deployment modes (`HOST`, `DEDICATED_WORKER`) and the shell↔app transport run over effect-rpc. This also removes `clientServiceBundle` from `@dxos/client-protocol`, which had no remaining consumers; the effect-rpc `rpc` surface and the Promise/`Stream` `services` surface are unchanged. A `remote_source` transport can be reintroduced over the effect-rpc `RpcPort` protocol if needed.
