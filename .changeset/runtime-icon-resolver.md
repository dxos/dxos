Runtime icon resolver: `ThemeProvider` mounts a shared `IconRegistry` that ingests the static `/icons.svg` sprite into an in-DOM defs container and resolves missing icons on demand from a per-icon-set route (Phosphor at `/phosphor/{weight}/{name}.svg` by default, configurable via `IconSource`), so icons referenced only by runtime-loaded plugins render without being present in the build-time sprite. `useIconHref` now returns a same-document `#name` href (or `undefined` while unresolved), and `<dx-icon>` consumes the same registry via a `globalThis.__dxIconRegistry` bridge. Breaking: the unused `noCache` prop is removed from `ThemeProvider`, `withTheme`, and `<dx-icon>` — cross-document sprite URLs are no longer built, so there is nothing to cache-bust.
