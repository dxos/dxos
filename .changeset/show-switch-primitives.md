Show/Switch conditional-rendering primitives. `<Show when fallback>` renders its children (or a render prop receiving the narrowed value) while `when` is present — anything except `undefined`/`null`/`false` — and `<Switch.Root on fallback>` renders the first `<Switch.Match when>` whose `when` strictly equals (or, as a predicate, matches) `on`. Both are DOM-free and mirror the ui-template `show`/`fallback`/`switch`/`match` grammar.
