Replace `SpaceOperation.OpenCreateObject` with `SpaceOperation.OpenObjectForm`, which returns a reference to the object the user confirmed (or nothing if the dialog was dismissed) instead of taking an `onCreateObject` callback. It also accepts a `schema` for callers with an ad-hoc form schema, and a `mode: 'live'` that adds the object to the database before the form opens — so fields resolving against the database behave as they do after creation — and removes it again on dismissal. This is a breaking rename: replace `OpenCreateObject` with `OpenObjectForm` and `initialFormValues` with `defaults`. A form whose root is a discriminated union now opens on the union's first member, and the required-field asterisk clears once a field holds a value.
