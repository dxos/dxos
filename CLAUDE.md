- project uses moon to run tasks, tests, lint etc. (moon run package-name:task-name).
- check the `moon.yml` for any package to see available tasks.
- lint task takes `--fix` argument to fix issues.
- use `moon :build --quiet --no-bail` to build all packages.
- when reaching a natural stopping point, run the linter for impacted packages.
- create a new branch before starting work.
- use `gh pr create` to create a pull request.
- use "Conventional Commits" for PR titles.
- ask for confirmation to ensure all work is complete and if so check that all packages build and pass linting and fix any problems that come up.
