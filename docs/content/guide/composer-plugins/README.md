# Quick Start

To prototype a plugin:

```bash
npm create @dxos/app-plugin@latest
```

This will create a working plugin project with a hot reloading development server.

The plugin definition is found in `src/plugin.ts`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start your development server with a core set of plugins and the plugin being prototyped.
