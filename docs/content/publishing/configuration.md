title: Configuration
---

The `config` object we send to our client during initialization shouldn't be directly define on our code, but rather provided on each environment.

```jsx
const config = {
  app: { title: 'Tasks App' },
  storage: { persistent: true },
  swarm: { signal: 'wss://apollo3.kube.moon.dxos.network/dxos/signal' },
};
```

Let's prepare the ground for this.

## Config Files

Create a folder `config` at the root of your project and add the following files:

- `config.yml`: _special_ file that will be loaded if the `CONFIG_DYNAMIC` property is set to `false`.
  If `CONFIG_DYNAMIC` is set to `true` each app will try to load from an endpoint (using `{publicUrl}/config/config.json`).
  This allows to dynamically inject settings to our applications.

- `defaults.yml`: contains the default values for your app.

- `envs-map.yml`: provides a map between `process.env` vars and the config paths.

You can just place the config object on `yml` format in the `defaults.yml` file and leave the other two empty:

```yml:title=defaults.yml
app:
  title: 'Tasks App'
storage:
  persistent: true
swarm:
  signal: 'wss://apollo3.kube.moon.dxos.network/dxos/signal'
```

## Importing the Config in the App

Once you have your config files created, add a file `src/config.js` and place the following code:

```js:title=src/config.js
import { Config, Envs, Defaults, Dynamics } from '@dxos/config';

const config = async () => new Config(await Dynamics(), Envs(), Defaults());

export const initConfig = () => config().then(({ values }) => values);
```

We are instantiating a `Config` object from `@dxos/config` package. This Config object is in charge of reading the files we created above:

```
Dynamics() -> config.yml
Envs() -> envs-map.yml
Defaults() -> defaults.yml
```

Finally, on our app, we should replace the `config` object with the `initConfig` function we are exporting above.

## Webpack ConfigPlugin

To make this package work properly, we need to make sure our Webpack settings have the `ConfigPlugin` from `@dxos/config` to load the config files.

```jsx:title=<root>/craco.config.js
const webpack = require('webpack');
const path = require('path');
const { ConfigPlugin } = require('@dxos/config/ConfigPlugin');
const BabelRcPlugin = require('@jackwilsdon/craco-use-babelrc');

const PUBLIC_URL = process.env.PUBLIC_URL || '';

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      plugin: BabelRcPlugin
    }
  ],
  webpack: {
    configure: (webpackConfig, { env, paths }) => {
      const buildFolder = path.join(__dirname, 'dist')
      webpackConfig.entry = './src/index.js'
      webpackConfig.output = {
        ...webpackConfig.output,
        path: buildFolder,
        filename: '[name].bundle.js',
        chunkFilename: '[name].[contenthash:8].chunk.js',
        publicPath: PUBLIC_URL,
      };
      paths.appBuild = buildFolder;
      return webpackConfig;
    },
    plugins: {
      add: [
       new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
          Buffer: [require.resolve('buffer/'), 'Buffer'],
        }),
        new ConfigPlugin({
          path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'config'),
          dynamic: process.env.CONFIG_DYNAMIC
        }),
      ],
    },
    config: {
      node: {
        Buffer: false
      }
    }
  },
};
```

> Remember, if you have your app running, you are going to need to stop it and start it again, so it takes new craco config into account. That's all!

If everything is properly set, your app should still be working same as it was on last section. But now, we are prepared to publicly deploy our app to a Kube.
