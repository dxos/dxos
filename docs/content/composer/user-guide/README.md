> I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter.

â€” Blaise Pascal ([Quote Investigator](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/04/28/shorter-letter/) translation)

Ideally no software would need a guide. The combination of familiar UI analogies and judicial use of tooltips would make a separate document unnecessary.

In reality, guides are underused. It's important to have explicit answers to the following questions:

- Where is my data physically stored?
- How can I share data with others? How do I tell who I've shared what with?
- How does deletion work? Is it true deletion or archiving, and how do I get data back?
