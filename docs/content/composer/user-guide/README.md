# Identity

::: warning Technology Preview
Composer is not yet ready for production. There are bugs, and breaking changes may occur. Migration guides will be provided for version updates in the [release notes](https://github.com/dxos/dxos/releases).

All your feedback is most welcome on [Discord](https://discord.gg/eXVfryv3sW).
:::

### Creation

Visiting a DXOS-power application in the browser will create a new identity for that browser profile.

### Device Invitations

Device Invitations allow users to synchronize their identity and data across multiple devices or applications (every app is a separate device, one per domain and browser profile). Invitations are generated by the user's primary device and can be accepted by any other device, including mobile devices and the [DXOS CLI](../../guide/tooling/cli/).
