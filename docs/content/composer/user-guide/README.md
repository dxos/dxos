# Intro

::: warning Technology Preview
Composer is not yet ready for production. There are bugs, and breaking changes may occur. Migration guides will be provided for version updates in the [release notes](https://github.com/dxos/dxos/releases).

All your feedback is most welcome on [Discord](https://discord.gg/eXVfryv3sW).

Ideally no software would need a guide. The combination of familiar UI analogies and judicial use of tooltips would make a separate document unnecessary.

However, while Composer's under heavy development it's easier to explain things explicitly.
