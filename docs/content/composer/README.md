# About

Composer is a team notetaking, whiteboarding, and knowledge management program.

It has three key features:

* **Extensibility**: If your team is operating in a challenging problem domain you need knowledge tools specific to your work. Composer is built for customization from the ground up.
* **Collaboration**: Composer has real-time multiplayer implemented through a local-first model. This makes a lot of things better: from meeting notes to working on airplanes.
* **Openness**: Not only are Composer and the DXOS protocols it's built on open source, the application is cloudless as well. Due to the [CRDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)-based implementation there's no need for a server other than for backup. DXOS provides backup services if you want them, but you can also host your own.
