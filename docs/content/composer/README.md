# About Composer

*Composer is built on the DXOS framework. If you want to know more about the framework, check out the [SDK docs](../guide).*

Composer is a team notetaking, whiteboarding, and knowledge management program.

It has three key features:

* **Extensibility**: If your team is operating in a challenging problem domain you need knowledge tools specific to your work. Composer is built for customization from the ground up.
* **Collaboration**: Composer has real-time multiplayer implemented through a local-first model. This makes a lot of things better: from meeting notes to working on airplanes.
* **Openness**: Not only are Composer and the DXOS protocols it's built on open source, the application is cloudless as well. Due to the [CRDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)-based implementation there's no need for a server other than for backup. DXOS provides backup services if you want them, but you can also host your own.

## Peer-to-peer

Composer gets its real-time collaboration and offline abilities through a peer-to-peer model.

For example a running system might sync data like this, where nodes represent devices:

![Alice and Bob device example](alice-and-bob-devices.svg)

Here [device](../guide/glossary.md#device) means a running DXOS instance. One device runs per browser profile, so users can have multiple devices running on a physical machine.

[Agents](../guide/tooling/cli/agent.md) are DXOS instances running without an attached user interface. A common use of agents is to run on a server and provide availability if all other devices are offline, but this is completely optional.
