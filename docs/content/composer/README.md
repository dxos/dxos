# Composer

Composer is a free, open-source, multiplayer, local-first knowledge environment powered by DXOS. Users can collaborate real-time, work offline, and retain privacy through the peer-to-peer protocols of DXOS. User data is never stored on any servers and does not leave devices the user trusts. Composer works entirely on the client with no private data silos.

Developers can extend Composer through plugins - every feature is implemented as a plugin that can be swapped or extended. Community contributions are most welcome.
