# About Composer

*Composer is built on the DXOS framework. If you want to know more about the framework, check out the [SDK docs](../guide).*

Composer is a team notetaking, whiteboarding, and knowledge management program.

It has three key features:

* **Extensibility**: If your team is operating in a challenging problem domain you need knowledge tools specific to your work. Composer is built for customization from the ground up.
* **Collaboration**: Composer has real-time multiplayer implemented through a local-first model. This makes a lot of things better: from meeting notes to working on airplanes.
* **Openness**: Not only are Composer and the DXOS protocols it's built on open source, the application is cloudless as well. Due to the [CRDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)-based implementation there's no need for a server other than for backup. DXOS provides backup services if you want them, but you can also host your own.

## Peer-to-peer

Composer gets its real-time collaboration and offline abilities through a peer-to-peer model.

For example a running system might sync data like this, where nodes represent devices and edges represent syncing connections:

```mermaid
graph BT;
  subgraph Alice
    AliceSmartphone["Alice's smartphone (Chrome)"]
    AliceDesktop["Alice's desktop (Chrome)"]
  end
  subgraph Bob
    BobDesktopChrome["Bob's desktop (Chrome)"]
    BobDesktopFirefox["Bob's desktop (Firefox)"]
    BobSmartphone["Bob's smartphone"]
  end
  subgraph Server
    Agent["<a href='../guide/tooling/cli/agent.md'>Agent</a>"]
  end
  AliceSmartphone<-->AliceDesktop
  AliceDesktop<-->BobDesktopChrome
  BobSmartphone<-->BobDesktopChrome
  BobDesktopFirefox<-->BobDesktopChrome
  Agent<-.->AliceDesktop
```

The syncing connections will re-adjust themselves as devices come on and offline. If Bob's desktop goes offline his smartphone will connect to either Alice's desktop or smartphone in order to stay up-to-date.

The use of an [Agent](../guide/tooling/cli/agent.md) is optional. Agents provide availability if all other devices are offline, but aren't required otherwise.
