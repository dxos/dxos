# Authoring

Composer supports [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) rich text formatting, including syntax-highlighted code blocks.

The first line of your document will automatically be used as the title.

## Creating

Click the <HopeIcon icon="plus" /> next to your <span class="composer-green">`Personal Space`</span> in the sidebar to create a new document.

Alternatively, when inside a space, press `Cmd + K` or `Ctrl + K` to open the command palette, and type `add`. Press `Enter` when the `Add to space`{class="ph ph-plus"} command is selected.

## Actions

Clicking the <HopeIcon icon="dots-three-vertical"/> next to a text document item reveals a menu with actions such as `Duplicate` or `Delete`.

## Vim mode

Open Settings using <HopeIcon icon="gear" /> and find the `Editor` section.

Set `Editor Mode` to `Vim` to enable Vim keybindings.
