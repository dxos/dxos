### Congratulations!

Your simple, shareable Tasks App is ready.

Now you know how to set up an instance of `Client`, make a profile, and create parties.

You are also aware of a variety of hooks which provide convenient access to client-connected items.

You have become familiar with the inviting process and know that there are ready-to-use components in `@dxos/react-client` and `@dxos/react-ux` which can speed up building your own app.

Please take the time to learn more about the DXOS capabilities and come up with new ideas for apps that share content. As you have seen, it's fast and easy to construct those apps using DXOS.

You can find all the code for this tutorial on this [Github repository](https://github.com/dxos/dxos-tutorial-tasks-app).
