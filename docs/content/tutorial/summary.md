### Congratulations!

Your simple shareable task list app is ready.

Now you know how to set up an instance of `Client`, make a profile, and create parties.

You are also aware of variety of hooks which provide convenient access to client-connected stuff.

You have gotten familiar with inviting process and know that there are ready-to-use components in `@dxos/react-client` and `@dxos/react-ux` which can speed up building your own app.

Take your time to learn more about DXOS capabilities and come up with new ideas for sharing content apps. As you have seen it's fast and easy to construct one with DXOS.
