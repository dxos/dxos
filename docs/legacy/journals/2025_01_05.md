- Network connectivity panel
- render entire System graph view
	- through devtools and decorators
	- renders as echo components that use echo-schema
	- annotation to omit the edge from the graph view
- reverse live-object/echo-schema dependency
	- symbols defined by echo-schema
		- schema
		- deleted
		- meta
		- entityKind
			- or make refs conditional on presence of source & kind?
		- source
		- target
		- parent?
	- lazy hidden toJSON and custom inspect registration
- https://dev.to/themuneebh/typescript-branded-types-in-depth-overview-and-use-cases-60e
- real [[Query Subsystem]] should have the same DataSource abstraction
- network manager abstracting over edge and calling teleport plugins
	- port.createWebStream({ objectMode: true })
- auth/sessions to network manager
- timeouts in classes should never schedule long jobs + IO
	- instead we should push it up
	- so that the runtime can schedule it with priority
	- + it could use alarms in DO
	- use echo classes on edge
- barriers that use async_local_storage that dissallow IO
	- uses async local storage
	- would only work in node/CF
	- still useful for tests
	- forbid not unreffed timeouts
	- forbid set timeout by linter
	- ```ts
	  await dissallowIo(async () => {
	    
	  })
	  
	  invaraint(canDoIo());
	  
	  scheduleTimeout(async () => {
	    
	  })
	  ```

- move all possible rules to oxc
	- first bench if updated eslint would run faster with no type rules
	- update eslint
	- https://typescript-eslint.io/packages/parser/#projectservice
- rename nx targets so that tools used are formatted as __toolname (e.g. `__tsc`, `__esbuild`, `__protobuf`)
- managed events that take in a scheduler instance
	- scheduler.runN
	- scheduler.runUntil
	- schduler.runAll
	- make async
		- MaybePromise
		- maybeThen for optional promissification
		- run vs runAsync for normal events
- AGI reasoning
	- o1
	- functions as tools
	- side-effect annotation for chain-of-thought/multi agent workflows
	- agents can go to sleep
	- agi agent is part of the canvas pipeline
	- agents build workflows
- ai that keeps issues up to date with the design
	- store referenced issues in the design doc
- outline vscode plugin
	- quick moves
	- inferes project structure
	- backreferences
	- index file maintainance
	- directories should be packlets
		- allow internal
