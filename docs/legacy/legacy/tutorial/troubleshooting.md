## Issues with storage

Sometimes when developing a DXOS application new version of the application can fetch old data from the storage that was used by previous versions. Those version conflicts may cause unxpected errors. In such cases it is recommended to clear storage using some dedicated extension - for instance [Clear site data](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clear-site-data/aihgofjefdlhpnmeakpnjjeajofpcbhj).
