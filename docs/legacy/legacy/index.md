description: Exploring the DXOS platform

Welcome! DXOS is a platform for building fullstack applications without any dependencies on centralized infrastructure.
It enables you to build privacy-preserving applications where users have complete control over their data.

This site includes tutorials and reference materials to help you get started, build, test and deploy completely decentralized applications.

We hope you enjoy building on DXOS and consider joining the movement.
