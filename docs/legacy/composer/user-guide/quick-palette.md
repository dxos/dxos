# Quick Palette

The Quick Palette is a floating window that provides quick access to content and actions from the keyboard.

Press `Cmd + K` or `Ctrl + K` to open the Quick Palette.

Search uses fuzzy matching. You can type any part of the name of the action or content you want to access.

Use the arrow keys to navigate the matched results.

Press `Enter` to invoke or jump to the highlighted item.

## Actions

Start a search with `/` to filter only actions.

Alternatively, use `Cmd + Shift + K` or `Ctrl + Shift + K` to open the Quick Palette with the action filter already applied.
