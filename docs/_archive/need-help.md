title: Need Help?

Learning a new technology can be overwhelming sometimes, and it's common to get stuck! If that happens, we recommend joining the [DXOS Discord Community](https://discord.gg/3xSXAxMM) and posting in the relevant channel (either `#eng-sdk` or `#eng-protocols`) for assistance from friendly fellow developers.

If anything in the documentation seems confusing or contains an error, we would like to know! On the right side of any page, click Edit on GitHub to create a pull request.
