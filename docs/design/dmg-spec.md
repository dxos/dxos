# DMG Spec

<!-- @toc -->

> - TODO(burdon): Merge archived docs.

## Terminology

**DMG Record** -
Typed document stored in the DMG.

**DMG Service** -
A server that supports queries and mutations against a local DMG instance. Resolved DXN URIs to DMG Records.

**DXN** -
A globally unique reference (URI) to a DMG Record.

**Subnet** - 
A cluster of KUBE nodes under local authority.


## Basic Concepts

The Decentralized Meta Graph (DMG) is a global federated content-addressable graph database.
The database stores **DMG Records** which can be referenced by a **DXN** (URI) or content hash.
DMG Records can represent various things (e.g., applications, releases, KUBE nodes, services, etc.)

### DXN

- A DXN is a globally unique dot-delimitered URI.
- The authority of a DXN is *anchored* by DNS (i.e., TLD, second-level domain, sub domain, etc.)
- DNS records may reference a DMG Server which is an authority for DXNs "lower down". E.g., `com.alice` may resolves to a DMG Server running on a Alice's Subnet. She controls the DNS record.

**Examples**
```
dx://org.dxos.type.app      # E.g., represents a protobuf schema definition.
dx://com.alice.app.tasks    # E.g., represents a deployed app.
```

> - ISSUE: Do registrars maintain a "flat" key-value store for domain names.
> - ISSUE: Cert issues for nested sub-domains?

### DMG Service

- KUBE nodes may run a DMG Service.
- The DMG Service handles query and mutation requests that involve DMG Records.
- A given DMG Service may handle OR dispatch query requests for the entire DMG. However, a DMG Service only has AUTHORITY for the domain that is registered with DNS. (e.g., the DMG Service at `alice.com` may respond with non-authoritative results for DXNs outside of the `com.alice` DXN namespace.)


## Scenarios

- Bob loads app from a URL entered into a browser.
  - How is the app served?
- Alice deploys an app to her local developer workstation.
- Alice deploys an app to a KUBE server on her local network (which may or may not have a publicly accessible endpoint).
- Alice deploys an app to the permissionless DXOS network.
- Alice publishes a document (e.g., type schema) to the DMG.
- Alice configured here DMG Service to intercept DXN requests which redirect to different records while in development mode.
  E.g., she wants to have an "authoratative" record accessible to everyone via a given URI (e.g., `com.alice.type.contact`) but wants an "in-progress" document available to her apps while in development running within her subnet.
  E.g., while developing the Tasks app, she wants to override references to the `org.dxos.types.task` schema.

**Example**

Alice creates the Tasks app, which is devloped in a Github repo (`@alice/tasks`).
She publishes the app to a locally running KUBE node (`kube.local`) using the `dx` CLI.
The `dx.yml` file in the repo represents a DMG Record which is inserted into the graph.
DMG Records are published to a given DXN controlled by the user.


### Desired Properties

- The Decentralized Meta Graph (DMG) is a global federated content-addressable graph database.
- DMG is used by all KUBE services as a canonical metadata store.
- DMG has both logical and physical partiions:
  - Logical partitions are controlled by an authority (e.g., DXOS, Alice).
  - Physical partitions are managed by one or more coordinated KUBE services.
- Deployed apps make use of an App schema that defines the structure of a Record that is stored in the DMG. The schema record may be controlled by a different namesapce within the DMG. 
  - In the case of an Application record, this data may be contained within a `dx.yml` file checked into the source code repo. 
  - For example, the App Service is a client of the DMG Service. It can resolve DXNs to find an associated App record, which may contain IPFS hashes for files that should be served by an app server.
- App server load-balancing/redirects.
- DMG Records can be versioned/tagged.


### Design

```
Browser(URL) => [ DMG(URI) => DMG Record ] => File
```

> - ISSUE: Users should NOT have to consider URLs when deciding on DXNs (i.e., how they organize their records).
> - ISSUE: Record inheritance (tree).


Consider the following URLs:
```
https://alice.com/tasks
https://tasks.alice.com
https://dxos.org/apps/tasks
https://dxos.org/types/record.json
https://alice.dxos.org
https://tasks.alice.dxos.org
https://beta.tasks.alice.dxos.org
```

- The URL contains 2 things (e.g., `https://tasks.alice.com`).
  - An enpoint to an App Service (e.g., `https://alice.com`).
  - A Path or URL segment that locates the associated Record that defines the App (e.g., files, resources) (e.g., `tasks`).
  - NOTE: The App Service is configured to use one or more DMG Services in order to resolve the URL/DXN.


```bash
curl https://tasks.alice.com
curl -H "Accept:application/json" https://kube.local/.well-known/dmg/com.alice.tasks

curl https://kube.local/.well-known/dmg?url=tasks.alice.com
curl https://kube.local/.well-known/dmg?dxn=com.alice.tasks
curl -H "Accept:application/json" https://tasks.alice.com 
```
