## 1. Introduction

ECHO (The **E**ventually **C**onsistent **H**ierrarhical **O**bject store) is a peer-to-peer graph database.

## 2. Terminology

***Atom*** -

***Party*** -
Context for collaboration and data replication.

***Epoch*** -

***Feed*** -
Append-only hash-linked datastructure containing immutable messages.

***Item*** -
Globally addressable data object.

***Link*** -

***Model*** -
Type-specific API associated with a data Item.

***Timeframe*** -
Monotonic sequence number used to order messages across multiple feeds.

## 3. Basic Concepts

ECHO is a decentralized graph database.

The diagram below illustrates the data processing pipeline.

## 4. Design

### 4.1. Message Ordering

#### 4.1.1. Timeframes

*   Messages are written with the peer's current timeframe. This creates a partial order.
*   Message ordering is determined by available feeds and the timeframes associated with messages.
*   Clients may process messages in different order (potential discrepancies are rectified downstream by the models).
*   DAG; require party key and first feed key.

TODO(burdon): Diagram.

### 4.2. Object Graph

*   Identity
*   Hierarchy

![Feeds](./diagrams//echo-graph.drawio.svg)

### 4.3. Links

### 4.4. Models and State Machines

*   Pipeline fan-in/out

### 4.5. Schema

### 4.6. Queries

*   Traversal
*   Filtering
*   Subscriptions

### 4.7. Branes

### 4.8. Epochs

Epochs are blocks of contiguous messages spanning all peers within a party.
They enable compression for quicker startup, and provide "sync" points for consensus and consistency.

Timeframes provide a common reference point for mutations across the feeds within a party.
However, when peers are partitioned, they start to diverge from each other.

> *   TODO(burdon): Write up branch anaolgy.

![Feeds](./diagrams//echo-feeds.drawio.svg)

#### 4.8.1. Control Feeds

*   Split out HALO and other control messages (like epoch genesis) into own set of feeds.
*   Each peer has a writable control feed in addition to its data (ECHO) feed.
*   Control feeds can be read and processed independently from data feeds.
*   They are piped into `PartyStateMachine`.

#### 4.8.2. Epoch Genesis

*   When a peer wants to start a new epoch they write an `EpochGensisMessage` into the control feed.
*   It contains the timeframe of when the new epoch starts and CID of the data snapshot at that timeframe.

#### 4.8.3. Snapshots

*   Snapshots allow peers to bootstrap the ECHO state machine from that point in time without reading feed messages before it.
*   Snapshots are content-addressed blobs consisting of a hierarchical set of reified HALO and ECHO models.
    *   HALO snapshots will be removed once control feeds are implemented.
    *   Each items outputs a snapshot from its corresponding model.
    *   If the model doesn't override the snapshot, then the list of messages is output.
*   They allow compression by removing history.
    *   The ObjectModel will just save the current state instead of the list of mutations.
*   Peers participate in snapshot exchange protocol, similar to BitTorrent.
    *   Based on party policy a particular peer may be authorized to declare snapshots (e.g., a bot); otherwise a peer election may be implemented.
*   Snapshots can be split into a tree of blobs as an optimization for more efficient storage/replication.
    *   This enables items to restore their models on demand (or for parties to only partially hydrate specific items).
*   Snapshots reference the hash of a previous snapshot, which may contain additional historical data.
    *   Certain models may decide to discard information when creating a snapshot.
        *   Examples: the MessengerModel may discard old messages; the ObjectModel may discard deleted objects.
    *   It may be possible for models to asynchronously load previous snapshots to retrieve historical information.
*   Snapshots may be analogous to blocks in a blockchain.
*   At the beginning of an epoch each model may decide to discard information (e.g., deleted items beyond a TTL);
    i.e,. that the snapshot currently being created omits certain data.
*   Bots may become file storage servers for large data sets, e.g., implementing proxy models (for thin clients).

## 5. Milestones

### 5.1. V0

*   [ ] Each model implements to/from snaphost (defined by protobuf).
    *   [ ] Models may decide to discard information.
*   [ ] Party creates tree of item snapshots.
*   [ ] Party records snapshot file, referenced by CID, which contains the following metadata:.
    *   Timeframe
    *   Datetime
    *   Previous snapshot CID
    *   Model versions
*   [ ] The epoch generator peer writes an epoch genesis message to its feed.
*   [ ] When peers process the epoch genesis message they create the corresponding snapshot and store it locally.
*   [ ] When peers join a party they may request the snapshot for a particular epoch.
*   [ ] Each peer stores the latest epoch genesis message for each party; this is used to bootstrap (and will be replaced later by the control feed).
*   [ ] Ability to simulate multi-peer paries with epoch generation.

ISSUES

*   [ ] Who initiates an epoch? E.g., leadership election; hardcoded (bot)?
*   [ ] What happens if peers join, but get "stale" messages from peers that have not yet joined the epoch?
*   [ ] What if the code changes for models.

![Architecture](./diagrams/echo-architecture.drawio.svg)

Processes mutations and snapshots to maintain a set of items and links with models.
ECHO is a hierrahical graph database where items a stored in a tree structure, connected by links.
Each item or link has state-machine and a model.

*   TODO: Packlets to enforce layer isolation?
    *   Factor out ECHO/HALO dispatch (e.g., make PartyManager, Database pluggable)
