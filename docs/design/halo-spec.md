## 1. Introduction

HALO is a set of protocols and components used to secure decentralized networks.
The HALO protocols enable self-sovereign identity, decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials, and other mechanisms relating to the security of decentralized systems.
HALO is implemented useing cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable messages.

Users and other network participants (Agents) maintain a HALO, which encompasses their identity, digital address book, and access control rights to digital assets withint the DXOS ecosystem.

<hr/>

## 2. Terminology

The following terms are capitalized when referenced in the document.

***Agent*** -
Participant (i.e., bot or user) in the peer-to-peer network.

***Authentication*** -
Mechanism to determine the identity of a given Agent.

***Authorization*** -
Mechanism to specify or determine the capabilities of a given Agent.

***Chain of Trust*** -
Credentials contain the public keys of both the Issuer and Subject and can be trivially verified by the recipient.
Messages may contain a DAG of Credentials where parent Credentials provide evidence of the validity of child Credentials.
For example, a Root Credential may assert a Claim that a given Subject (A) has ownership of a particular asset;
A subsequent Credential may then assert that a different Subject (B) has a different right conferred by the owner (A) of the asset.

***Circle*** - 
A set of keys and metadata relating to a set of network Agents known to a given Agent.

***Claim*** -
An assertion made about a subject.
Claims may represent ownership of digital assets, access control, status, and other properties determined by the Issuer.

***Credential*** - 
A set of verifiable Claims issued by an Issuer to a Subject, typically used during requests to third-Space services.
Credentials are signed by the Issuer to prove their validity.
Typically the Subject signs the Credential to prove the validity of the request.

***Device*** - 
Peer belonging to an Agent that belongs to a HALO Space.

***DID*** -
W3C specification for a Decentralized Identifier which can be used to authenticate an Agent.

***DXNS*** -
A Federated Decentralized Naming Service that resolved structure document by an associated public key, DXN, DID, Peer DID, or domain name.

***ECHO Space*** - 
Decentralized graph database instance secured by the HALO protocols.

***Feed*** - 
Hash-linked append-only signed log of immutable messages.

## 3. Specification

A HALO is a secure, replicated, peer-to-peer database containing an Agent's decentralized credentials.
The HALO is used to manage identity, credentials, Devices, and the Agent's Circle.

The HALO protocols are implemented by components that form part of smart clients that can run securely  cross-platform (e.g., Web browser, Mobile app, Terminal client, backend service.)

1. ***Identity***
   - Agents can create and manage multiple identities.
   - Agents can recover an identity from a 24-word seed phrase.
   - Identities can be used across Devices without sharing private keys.
   - Agents can manage and use multiple isolated identities on a single Device.
   - Agents have a public decentralized identifier that can be shared with others.
   - Identities can be used to establish connections between Devices belongong to Agents on the MESH network.

2. ***Profiles***
   - Agents can manage a globally accessible public document that contains metadata they wish to share (e.g., display name).
   - Profiles can be discovered across the network by the agent's public identifier.

3. ***Credential Management***
   - Entities can create and share credentials that can represent an extensible set of verifiable claims.
   - Agents can manage a decentralized set of credentials.

4. ***Device Management***
   - Agents can manage a set of verified Devices.
   - Devices can be revoked.
   - Devices can be used to recover identity.

5. ***Circles***
   - Agents can maintain a decentralized set of contacts and profile documents for other agents across the network.

## 4. Design

### 4.1. HALO

The HALO consists of a secure Device-local key store and a peer-to-peer replicated graph database implemented by the ECHO protocols.

The HALO contains:
- A set of Credentials that represent various decentralized claims (e.g., Blockchain accounts, KUBE access control, ECHO Spaces, external Web2 tokens).
- A set of Device public keys (and other metadata).
- A set of third-party Agent public keys and metadata (e.g., cached DID Profile documents) representing the Agent's Circle.

#### 4.1.1. Protocol Definitions

The HALO protocol definitions are defined by [protobuf schema](https://github.com/dxos/protocols/tree/main/packages/common/protocols/src/proto/dxos/halo).

#### 4.1.2. Identity

- Agents create an [TODO: ED25519] key pair.
- Key pairs can be recovered from a [TODO: 24-word] seed phrase.
- **NOTE**: The identity private key is only used to generate the HALO and to recover an identity. It is not used to sign messages.

#### 4.1.3. Profiles

- Agents can create and update a content addressable Profile Document that conforms to a HALO protocol buffer schema.
- Profile Documents contains standard meta data (e.g., display name) as well as custom properties that can be set by the user and decentralized applications.
- Profile Documents are stored by a KUBE-supported IPFS network and accessed via DXNS.
- **NOTE**: IPNS is impractical since it only support single private-key access.

#### 4.1.4. DID Documents

- Agents may publish a [DID Document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#abstract) that can be used to authenticate an Agent. 
- DID Documents may be resolved by the assosicated DID via a decentralized DID controller (e.g., blockchain) or a trusted peer-to-peer network (e.g., KUBE).

#### 4.1.5. Credentials

- Credentials are represented by a schema defined by the HALO protocol.
  The schema format is inspired by the [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model).
- Credentials may represent ownership or access to digital assets, including KUBE nodes and ECHO Spaces.
- Credentials should generally have narrow claims (separation of concerns).
- ISSUE: Consider integration with hardware wallets?

#### 4.1.6. HALO Genesis

- Once an Agent's Identity has been created on a Device a special ECHO Space is created that instantiates the Agent's HALO (see below).
- The Agent's Identity public key is used to create the Genesis messages, and used as the HALO Space identifier.

#### 4.1.7. Device Authorization and Authentication

- Each Device creates a [TODO: ED25519] key pair and maintains a secure key store.
- The key store is encrypted and optionally protected by a password and/or second factor authenticator.
- Devices must be authorized and authenticated before joining a HALO.
- Devices may only join one HALO.
- Authorization requires a peer-to-peer session where the existing and joining Devices exchange public keys. This handshake may require a second factor authentication.
- The existing Device writes a `Device Auth` message to the HALO that includes the joining Device's public key.
  - The `Device Auth` message may contain permissions that scope the capabilities of the Device (e.g., Admin, Write, Read), and an expiration time that necessitates re-authorization later on.
- The joining Device authenticates by presenting a signed message using the Device key corresponding to the `Device Auth` message. 
  - The message contains the Device's feed keys; the existing Device writes a `Feed Admit` message containing these keys to the HALO.
  - This determines which feeds replicated by each Device peer.
- Devices may write revocation messages to the HALO, which cancel prior authorizations.
  - ISSUE: There is the potential for a race, whereby two Devices may attempt to revoke access to the other. Revocation may require a multi-Device "vote" or a second factor authentication method.

The diagram below illustrates the chain of trust formed during Agent and Device authorization.

![Credentials](./diagrams//halo-credentials.drawio.svg)

> **NOTE**: Device Authorization and Authentication does not itself ***require*** Credentials.
  Authorized Devices write `Device Auth` authorization messages to their corresponding feed
  and Devices present authentication messages when joining the swarm.
  However, Credentials ***are*** written to the HALO so that they can be presented to ECHO Spaces to demonstrate a chain of trust for authorized Devices (see below).

#### 4.1.8. Circles

- The HALO database contains a set of records representing third-party agents.
- These records contain Agent keys (e.g., DIDs) and other metadata (e.g., cached Profiles).
- The HALO may also contain claims relating to other Agents.


### 4.2. ECHO Spaces

An ECHO Space is a collaborative peer-to-peer graph database secured by the HALO protocols.
Internally ECHO Spaces are used to create decentralized HALO databases.

#### 4.2.1. Protocol Definitions

The ECHO protocol definitions are defined by [protobuf schema](https://github.com/dxos/protocols/tree/main/packages/common/protocols/src/proto/dxos/echo).

#### 4.2.2. Genesis

- Spaces are created on an Agent's Device.
- On creation, a temporary key pair is generated and used to sign a set of `Genesis` messages.
- The Genesis messages include access control and Device authorization for the originating Agent.
- After Genesis, the private key is destroyed.
- The public key (or hash) may be used as a discovery key to advertise or locate a Space on the peer-to-peer MESH network.

#### 4.2.3. Agent Authorization

- Spaces contain a DAG of `Agent Auth` messages that determine the capabilities of any ***Device*** controlled by the specified Agent. 
- These messages are written to control feeds by a previously authorized Device and contain the public identity key of the given Agent.
- The authorization process may be initiated by sending an invitation token to the invitee.
  - The token contains the Space's discovery key, which is used to connect the inviter and joining Devices via the MESH network. 
  - This initiates a handshake where joining Agent's Identity public key is sent to the inviting Device.
  - If the invited Agent's Identity key is already know to the inviter (e.g., via the Agent's Circle), then the `Agent Auth` message can be written "offline", allowing the joining Device to authenticate at a later time.

#### 4.2.4. Device Authentication

- On joining a Space, the Device presents a Credential containing a claim that it is authorized to act on behalf of a given Agent.
- This Credential must be signed using either the Agent's Identity private key, or an authorized Device's private key.
- The verifying Device requires a chain-of-trust that demonstrates that the joining device belongs to the Agent.
  - The joining Device may, therefore, present a set of Credentials (from its corresponding HALO) that demonstrate transitive authorization (e.g., Agent A authorizes Device 1, which was used to authorize Device 2).
  - On successful authorization the verifying Device writes a `Feed Admit` message to its control feed similar to the HALO Device authorization process above.
- **NOTE**: After the inviting Device has written the `Agent Auth` message, ANY Device belonging to ANY previously authorizated Agent (with invitation permissions) may complete the authentication and `Feed Admit` process.

The diagram below illustrates the chain of trust formed during Agent and Device authorization.

![Credentials](./diagrams//halo-credentials-space.drawio.svg)

### 4.3. Design Issues

- TODO: Use blockchain hash as timestamp for revocation messages. Finality?
- TODO: DXNS
  - hybrid/federated KUBE p2p/blockchain.
  - maintain a map of name (DXN) => Document (typed record) with a set of Credentials (that contains a set of public keys that have Issuer over the document).
  - DID resolver?
  - DNS resolver?
- TODO: Peer DID resolution?
- TODO: Optionally publish Github credential (claim) to HALO as backup-recovery?

<hr/>

## 5. Security

- TODO: Privacy, Trust Models, and Threats
- TODO(pierre): Privacy review (for Spaces and Peer signaling).
  - ISSUE: A time-salted hash of the associated Public key may be used to discover the Space (i.e., MESH discovery key).
  - This hash may be transmitted publicly (e.g., as a discovery key for signaling) and provides one degree of privacy.

### 5.1. Aspects of Trust

| Aspect                  | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Availability            | Can the information be found from any node within the network?  |
| Correctness             | Is the information tamper-resistent and verifiable?             |
| Consensus and Finality  | Can agreement across all peers be determined (and when)?        |
| Privacy                 | Can the information be seen by others on a public network?      |
| Censorship Resistance   | Is all current information visible?                             |

> TODO: Find another reference for this?

### 5.2. Trust Models

| System  | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| KUBE    | Trusted server controlled by authenticated and authorized Agent.                |
| ECHO    | Trustless peer-to-peer network controlled by HALO.                              |
| MESH    | Trusted subnet or decentralized network (e.g., DXOS).                           |
| IPFS    | Trusted subnet of blockchain controlled network (e.g., Filecoin, DXOS)          |
| DXNS    | Trusted subnet or decentralized network (e.g., DXOS).                           |
| DNS     | Trusted subnet or global network controlled by root servers.                    |

## 7. Deprecated Notes

> - TODO: Add diagram references.

### 7.1. Credential message
 
A Credential message consists of:
- Signed part:
  - Timestamp of credential creation.
  - Nonce as a randomly generated by string. [Allow different signatures to have different nonces, allowing for more efficient presentation]
  - Dynamically typed payload encoded via `google.protobuf.Any`.
- List of signatures, each having:
  - The signing public key.
  - The signature itself.
  - Optional KeyChain.

ED25519 curve is used for signatures via [hypercore-crypto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hypercore-crypto) package.

### 7.2. Key chain

> See packages/common/protocols/src/proto/dxos/halo/keys.proto

A set of credential messages that establishes a chain of trust between the signing key and the trusted keys.
Allows for delegation of Issuer.

KeyChain is stored in a tree-like data structure.
Each entry consists of:
- Public key being described.
- A signed credential message where the public key is the subject of the credential.
- Zero or more parent KeyChains establishing the trust of the keys that signed the credential.

Example:

Parties admit identity keys as members. When a Device signs a credential, it produces a signature using it's own Device key and attaches a KeyChain containing a KeyAdmit message, admitting the Device key to the HALO.

> Q: What's the difference between including KeyChain as a parent of a different KeyChain vs having the credential message of that KeyChain entry be signed with the first KeyChain.

> TODO: It seems only the signatures of credential messages are verified and the claims are ignored.
