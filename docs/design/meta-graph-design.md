## 1. Terminology

**Credential** - Verifiable credential that enables decentralized access control within the Subnet (e.g., administrative, read/write, replication, control).
Each KUBE maintains a secure Credential store.

> *   Conceptually part of HALO, but may be implemented via TLS.
> *   TODO: Disambiguation TLS certificates from credentials (vs. CA/DNS).
> *   TODO: Connect Pierre with Ben Laurie!

**DNS** - Global authority for domain records.

**KUBE** - Individual Host (Subnet Node) running the KUBE daemon.

> *   TODO: Consider renaming but used `kube` until determined.

**Realm** - Logical partition of the federated DMG consistent across the Subnet.

**Root CA** - Root Certification (for the Subnet). Used to enroll KUBEs into the Subnet and is the root for other Credentials used within the Subnet.

**Subnet** - A cluster of KUBE nodes under local authority.

## 2. Concepts

*   DMG is a decentralized federated graph.
*   It consists of locally controlled subnets that are made up of KUBE nodes.

### 3.1. Server

*   Each KUBE runs a Web server that handles HTTP request.
    *   The host (example.com) is a subnet (DNS may be managed by the subnets own DNS servers).

*   Example URL:
    *   <https://dev.example.com/office/notepad>
    *   <https://example.com/dev/office/notepad>
    *   <https://example.com/office/notepad/dev>

*   The Web server resolved \['/dev', '/office/notepad'] to a DMG record (which is represented by a git ref)
    *   ISSUE: Is the subdomain special -- e.g., should it represent a "Realm"?
        *   Realm is a unit of organization of files (users can have an unlimited number)
        *   Possible to map local subnet Realms onto other Realms? (e.g., live.rich.com/app => beta.example.com/app)
        *   If not, then the first 2 URLs above would be equivalent?
        *   ISSUE: Browser subdomain isolation
        *   ISSUE: Browser will resolve files relative to URL (not to contents of record)
    *   The DMG record is a typed record (protobuf) that defines the resource
    *   The record may reference other files within the DMG (e.g., PNG, JSON document, index.html, javascript, Android PDK)
    *   Based on the record type, the web server returns the associated content

        <https://dev.example.com/office/notepad>
        \=> DMG Record{ mime: 'text/html', path: 'index.html', ref: tree-ish, ...meta }
        <https://dev.example.com/office/notepad/index.html>   => tree-ish/index.html
        <https://dev.example.com/office/notepad/main.js>      => tree-ish/main.js

        `curl https://dev.example.com/office/notepad => index.html`
        `curl -H "Accept:application/dmg" https://dev.example.com/office/notepad | jq`
        \=> JSON DMG record (represents the app bundle)

        (NOTE: tree-ish == SHA)

        curl <https://dev.example.com/office/notepad/main.js> => main.js

        *   Path requests are relative to the nearest ancestor representing a DMG record

        *   E.g., HTTP GET `https://dev.example.com/office/notepad/main.js` is handled by the Web server
            *   First we request the DMG record associated with the nearest ancestor (i.e., `dev::office/notepad`)
                *   (This is equivalent to `curl -H "Accept:application/dmg" -H "Authorization:xxx" https://dev.example.com/office/notepad`)
            *   The DMG record references a SHA and path
            *   The relative path from this entry point is then used to serve an individual file

        *   ISSUE: One repo per Realm?

        *   ISSUE: Are we overloading browser isolation with Realm organization?

        *   ISSUE: DMG record can map subpath onto Lambda

### 3.2. Implementation

### 3.3. Realms

*   Each KUBE Node creates a single local repo named `dmg` (`~/.kube/dmg.git`).
*   Suppose we have a Subnet controlled by `alice` with three KUBE Nodes (`a1`, `a2`, `a3`).
    Each local repo has a `remote`, which references the other Nodes on the Subnet.
*   All changes to the repo are replicated (pushed) to other Nodes.
*   The Subnet maintains a locally consistent repo.

## 4. Issues

2022-07-26 \[RB, Zhenya]

*   ISSUE: Mapping URLs onto records (e.g., significance of subdomain and path)?
*   ISSUE: Management of records (e.g., into Realms)

2022-07-24 \[RB, Pierre]

*   What are the relationships between URL => Realm => Refs (and the implied mapping)?
*   Of course URL => Subnet, but the part of the URL that isn't just the host (i.e., subnet) consists of (possibly) a subdomain name (alice.example.com) and a path (/notepad).
*   That's what i'm calling a "name" or DXN (i.e., alice/notepad).
*   So a URL identifies both a Subnet and a resource Name (DXN).
*   Names (DXNs) contain both a Realm and a Resource (path). E.g., "alice.notepad" references the Realm "alice" and the Resource "notepad".
*   Questions:
*   1.  Can Realms be hierarchical (e.g., dxos.devnet vs. alice).
*   2.  Are Realms fixed to Subnets? Are they fixed to Domain names? (What if I don't have a domain name? What if I want to transfer them?). I don't think they are.
*   3.  But if not, then how do we have globally unique Realm names?
*   4.  DMG maintains the map between the name and the refs -- what is the model for this? Each subnet is responsible for maintaining it's own map -- since each subnet is the AUTHORITY (with different forms of consensus) for it's SET of realms.

## 5. Notes

    alice (alice.com) :: [a1, a2, a3]
        /alice/notepad
        /alice/tasklist
        /bob/notepad
            /pub

    bob (bob.com) :: [b1]
        /bob/notepad
            /dev
            /pub

    Browser
        https://dxos.org/.well-known
                            /status
                            /ipfs/Qx28237982374982

        https://dxos.org/alice/notepad

                        => App Service running on the dxos.org cluster (resolved by DNS)
                            /alice/notepad 
                                => /refs/dxos.org/alice/notepad/prod => { dx.yml, index.html, indes.js }

        DXNS (runs on every Subnet)
            - Maps DXN path/name (embedded within URL and subdomain) to git ref; App server then retrieves and serves these files.
            - Allows publishing via either:
                - Blockchain based authority (which dxos.org runs, and rich.com also chooses to run) has on-chain map.
                    - Trust based on account
                - Local (running on pcarrier.com) authority based on ssh keys and mapping within git.


    On Alice's workstation

        /refs/heads/alice/notepad

    Publishing to dxos.org

        1. Create DX account for DXNS (since dxos.org is running the DXNS service).
        2. Create authority `alice` by staking DX tokens (required by DXNS service).
        3. Publish 
            - create empty signed commit (aka release branch)
            - push commit to local repo then replicate to dxos.org

    Publishing locally

        [DNS domain subnet]/[authority]]/[resource]
