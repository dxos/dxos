# HALO Identity

HALO is a system of components for implementing decentralized identity designed around privacy, security, and collaboration requirements.

- The HALO **Shell** manages the user's identity and connected devices. It's available as a [component](https://github.com/dxos/dxos/tree/main/packages/sdk/shell) and a [stand-alone application](https://halo.dxos.org).
- The HALO [**SDK**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dxos/client) is part of the DXOS client library and provides user authentication, identity, and contact management capabilities.
- The HALO **protocol** supports the verification, transport, and exchange of identity information between networked peers.

The HALO application also acts as a secure vault where all ECHO data is physically stored on behalf of the user and their applications.

## Features

- Public/private key-pair authentication mechanism integrated into ECHO
- Passwordless log in
- Local-first credentials and key storage
- Multi-device synchronization of identities, credentials, ECHO spaces

## Establishing user identity

There are two ways a user can establish their identity (login) with DXOS on any given [device](../glossary#device).

1.  Visiting any DXOS-powered application in the browser will immediately initialize a HALO identity for the user.
2.  Accepting a [device invitation](#device-invitations) will synchronize the user's identity from another device.

In the future, we plan to support recovering an identity using a [seed phrase](../glossary#seed-phrase), sometimes referred to as paper key recovery.

## Shell

Shell is a [UI component](https://github.com/dxos/dxos/tree/main/packages/sdk/shell) that provides a user interface for managing the user's identity and connected devices. It can be embedded in any browser-based application.

You can experiment with the Shell at <https://halo.dxos.org>.

### Device Invitations

Device Invitations allow users to synchronize their identity and data across multiple devices. Invitations are generated by the user's primary device and can be accepted by any other device, including mobile devices and the [DXOS CLI](../cli).

## Next steps

How to read the HALO identity in code:

- Use the [`useIdentity` hook in react](../react/identity)
- Use the [`client.halo.profile` field in TypeScript](../typescript/identity)
