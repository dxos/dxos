# HALO Identity

HALO is a system of components for implementing decentralized identity designed around privacy, security, and collaboration requirements.

*   The HALO [**application**](https://halo.dxos.org) is a software wallet that contains user identities, secrets (i.e.: private keys), other credentials.
*   The HALO [**SDK**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dxos/client) is part of the DXOS client library and provides user authentication, identity, and contact management capabilities.
*   The HALO **protocol** supports the verification, transport, and exchange of identity information between networked peers.

The HALO application also acts as a secure vault where all ECHO data is physically stored on behalf of the user and their applications. Read more about [local vault topology](../platform/#local-vault-topology).

## Features

*   Public/private key-pair authentication mechanism integrated into ECHO
*   Passwordless log in
*   Local-first credentials and key storage
*   Multi-device synchronization of identities, credentials, ECHO spaces
*   Paper-key identity recovery

## Establishing user identity

There are three ways a user can establish their identity (login) with HALO on any given [device](../glossary#device).

1.  Create a new identity
2.  Use an identity from another device
3.  Recover an identity using a [seed phrase](../glossary#seed-phrase)

Open <https://halo.dxos.org> and you will be guided through the options.

## Next steps

How to read the HALO identity in code:

*   Use the [`useIdetity` hook in react](../react/identity)
*   Use the [`client.halo.profile` field in TypeScript](../typescript/identity)
