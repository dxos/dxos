# Telemetry

KUBE collects anonymous telemetry about how it's being used in the wild. This data is used to debug and improve KUBE. If you're running a KUBE, we really appreciate your telemetry, as it is essential to keeping the component healthy and helps us focus only on the features you use most.

To disable telemetry:

```bash
kube config telemetry.disabled true
sudo kube restart
```
