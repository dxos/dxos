# Telemetry

KUBE collects **anonymous** telemetry about how it's being used in the wild. This data is used to debug and improve KUBE. 

We really appreciate your telemetry as it is essential to keeping KUBE healthy and helps us focus only on the features you use most.

To disable telemetry:

```bash
kube config telemetry.disabled true
sudo kube restart
```
