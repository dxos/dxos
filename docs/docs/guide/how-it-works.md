# How it works

- decentralized applications require a consensus model
- serving application code and exchanging data are separate things
- IPFS, what it is, where it comes from, how we use it to host content
- connectivity: networking topology, peer to peer options in the browser
- conflict free replicated datatypes
- problems with CRDTs
- unique solutions within DXOS: epochs, vector clocks, bots
