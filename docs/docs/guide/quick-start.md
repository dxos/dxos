# Quick start

DXOS is the developer platform for **collaborative**, **offline-first**, **privacy-preserving** software.<br/> Learn more about our [mission](why).

*   [Templates](#creating-apps-with-dx-cli) for creating local-first apps
*   [Using the ECHO database](#using-the-echo-database) for real-time, offline-first consensus
*   [Installing KUBE infrastructure](#starting-a-kube) for hosting apps locally
*   [Deploying apps to KUBE](#deploying-your-app-to-a-kube)

## Creating apps with `dx` CLI

The `dx` CLI offers a production-ready application template based on `vite` with `typescript`, `react`, `pwa`, and other opinions built in.

Install:

```bash
pnpm i -g @dxos/cli
```

:::note
Only [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) is supported for now, temporarily (`npm i -g pnpm`).
:::

Now you can use the `dx` command line tool:

```bash
dx app create hello # or with --template=bare
cd hello
pnpm serve
```

This will start the development server.

## Using the ECHO database

[ECHO](overview#echo) is a peer-to-peer graph database designed for offline-first and real-time collaboration. There is no central server, peers exchange data directly over p2p connections.

Install:

```bash
pnpm i @dxos/client
```

To use ECHO, start with an instance of the [`Client`](echo/configuration).

Before storing data, your client needs to create or join a [space](echo/spaces).

```ts file=./echo/snippets/create-space.ts#L5-
import { Client } from '@dxos/client';

const client = new Client();

const space = await client.echo.createSpace();
```

Now you can manipulate items in the space and they will replicate with all members of the space in a peer-to-peer fashion.

```ts file=./echo/snippets/write-items.ts#L5-
import { Client, DocumentModel } from '@dxos/client';

const client = new Client();

// decide on a type for your items
const type = 'yourdomain:type/some-type-identifier';

// get a list of all spaces
const { value: spaces } = client.echo.querySpaces();

// create a regular DocumentModel item
const item = await spaces[0].database.createItem({
  type,
  model: DocumentModel
});

// set a property value
item.model.set('someKey', 'someValue');

// query items
const items = spaces[0].database.select({ type });
```

### React usage

Use `ClientProvider` and `useClient` with React:

```tsx file=./echo/snippets/create-client-react.tsx#L5-
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { ClientProvider, useClient } from '@dxos/react-client';

const Component = () => {
  const client = useClient();
  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(client.toJSON(), null, 2)}</pre>;
};

const App = () => (
  <ClientProvider>
    <Component />
  </ClientProvider>
);

createRoot(document.body).render(<App />);
```

## Starting a KUBE

[KUBE](kube/overview) hosts and serves applications and provides supporting services like peer network discovery.

Install KUBE:

```bash file=./snippets/install-kube.sh
sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://install-kube.dxos.org)"
```

Then:

```bash
sudo kube start # start the service in the background
kube status # verify it's running
```

**Once KUBE is running, you're ready to deploy to it.**

## Deploying your app to a KUBE

To deploy to your local KUBE:

*   Ensure a [KUBE](#starting-a-kube) is running
*   Ensure the [`dx` CLI](#creating-apps-with-dx-cli) is installed
*   Ensure there is a [`dx.yml`](kube/dx-yml-file) file in the project root

If you're using the DXOS application template (from `dx app create`):

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

To deploy any static app with a `dx.yml` file:

```bash
dx app publish
```

Your app will now be accessible in a browser `http://<app-name>.localhost`.

If you started with `dx app create hello`, the app will be on [`hello.localhost`](http://hello.localhost).

**Your app will now always be available on your machine until it or KUBE is stopped.**

:::note
Coming soon:

*   `tunnelling`: ability to expose apps on your KUBE to the public internet
*   `console`: a management console for the apps running on your KUBE
