# Developer Tools

Using this tool you can connect to any instance of ECHO to visualize and debug the state of the application.

There are two ways to run the tool:

*   Launch the standalone [Developer Tools](https://devtools.dxos.org) as an application and point it to the vault using using the `?target=vault:https://...` argument in the URL.
*   Install the browser extension [DXOS Client Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dxos-client-developer-too/ioofnlghmmdbmkadofabikgcgjacnnaf) and it will connect to the vault of the app being debugged in the browser's devtools.
