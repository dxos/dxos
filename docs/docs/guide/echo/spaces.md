# Spaces

Spaces are the unit of sharing and access control in ECHO. Roughly equivalent to a "collection" in a document store, a space is a logical boundary around a set of items which are to be replicated amongst a set of peer members of the space. A given is typically a part of many spaces at any given time.

There are several steps to establishing a space between peers:
1. Peer A listens on the peer network for peers intereseted in a specific invite code
2. Peer B obtains the invite code and locates the listening peer A via the signaling network
3. Peer A and B establish a secure connection via Diffie Hellmann key exchange
4. Peer A decides on a secret PIN code
5. To complete the connection, Peer B must provide the PIN code to Peer A over the secure connection

After a space with a peer is established, the peer's public ket becomes "known" to the user's HALO and subsequent mutual spaces are easier to negotiate.

```tsx
import { space } from '@dxos/client';
import { useClient } from '@dxos/react-client';

export const App = () => {
  const client = useClient();
  const [space_key, setspaceKey] = useMemo<space>();
  const [space, setspace] = useMemo<space>();

  useEffect(() => {
    void (async () => {
      const space = await client.echo.createspace({ title: 'New space' });
      setspace(space);
    })();
  }, []);
  
  if (!space) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>space: {space.key.toHex()}</div>
  );
};
```

```tsx
const invitation = await space.createInvitation();
```
