# HALO

HALO is a system of components for implementing decentralized identity designed around privacy, security, and collaboration requirements.

*   The HALO application is a software wallet that contains user identities, secrets (i.e.: private keys), other credentials.
*   The HALO SDK is part of the DXOS client library and provides user authentication, profile, and contact management capabilities.
*   The HALO protocol supports the verification, transport, and exchange of identity information between networked peers.

The HALO application also acts as a secure vault where all ECHO data is physically stored on behalf of the user and their applications. Read more about [local vault topology](../echo/#local-vault-topology).
