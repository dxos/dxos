# Establishing user identity

There are three ways a user can establish their identity (login) with HALO on any given [device](../glossary#device).
1. Create a new identity
2. Use an identity from another device
3. Recover an identity using a [seed phrase](../glossary#seed-phrase)

Open [https://halo.dxos.org](https://halo.dxos.org) and you will be guided through the options.
