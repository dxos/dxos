This tutorial assumes zero knowledge of DXOS and is intended to serve as a starting point for building applications with DXOS.

## Before We Start

The main part of this tutorial is divided into several sections:

- [Overview](./overview): will teach you the fundamentals of DXOS.
- [Development Environment](./dev-environment): will teach you how to setup your local development environment.
- [Address and Account Setup](./address-account-setup): will teach you how to create a developer account on DXNS.
- [Create A Frame](./create-frame): will teach you how to create building blocks for peer-to-peer apps.
- [Deploy Frame](./deploy-frame): will teach you how to deploy your code to DXNS.

## What Are We Building?

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to build a tasks list app. This is a basic example app but it will showcase how simple it is to build collaborative peer-to-peer applications with DXOS.

You can see what we'll be building here: [Final Result](https://codesandbox.io/).

## Prerequisites

In this tutorial we will be assuming familiarity with React, Typescript and Yarn. While the DXOS stack itself does not depend on React, the all the official SDK packages are built for React at this point in time.

Before proceeding, make sure your system has the following installed:

- Node.js v16+
- Yarn v1.20+
