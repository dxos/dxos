## Overview

DXOS consists of a few technologies that work together:

*   [ECHO](echo) Database and state container for offline-first and real-time collaborative apps.
*   [HALO](halo) Identity for decentralized apps.
*   [MESH](mesh) Networking for peer to peer apps.
*   [KUBE](kube) Self-contained infrastructure for hosting and operating decentralized apps.
