## Overview

DXOS consists of a few technologies that work together:

*   [ECHO](echo) - Database and reactive state container for offline-first, real-time, collaborative apps.
*   [HALO](halo) - Identity for decentralized apps.
*   [KUBE](kube) - Self-contained infrastructure for hosting and operating decentralized apps.

## [Quick Start](quick-start.md)

- Start a project with an [app template](quick-start#create-an-app)
- Use [ECHO](quick-start#echo-state-consensus) for state consensus
- Start up a [KUBE](quick-start#starting-a-kube) to host your app
- [Deploy](quick-start#deploying-your-app-to-a-kube) your app to the KUBE
