# Known Issues

The following issues are known to affect usability:

*   [Firefox browser does not work](https://github.com/dxos/dxos/issues/3551)

# Stability and Security

The DXOS platform and SDK is currently in a technology preview state.

This means:

*   Persistence, integrity, or confidentiality of user data is not guaranteed.
*   Protocols, libraries, and SDKs are likely to change, so DXOS SDK components should not yet be used for production.
*   Security of the platform and SDK is immature and incomplete. Identity and device authentication is verified using strong encryption. Data is encrypted in transit. Data stored locally, in-browser, in [OPFS](https://fs.spec.whatwg.org/#origin-private-file-system) or [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) may not be encrypted.

# Performance, Reliability, and Scale: Current state
## Cold Start
On startup, all mutations must be loaded before the space is available to use.

**Browser: 35k mutations/sec**

**Agent: 50k mutations/sec**

Under normal conditions, a space will have 5,000 or less mutations, so cold startup time will be **less than a second**.

## Replication
Changes to a space need to be replicated to peers. When sharing a space to a new peer, or when a peer comes back online, it must receive all mutations.

**Browser: 800 mutations/sec**

**Agent: 1300 mutations/sec**

**1 MB/s throughput.**

Under normal conditions, full replication will take **10 seconds** or less.

## Reliability and Scalability
Our communications protocol currently establishes a separate mesh of connections per shared space. A [Mostly Minimal Spanning Tree](https://github.com/RangerMauve/mostly-minimal-spanning-tree) is used to minimize the connections per node. For example, two users sharing three spaces will result in three connections, but four users sharing one space will create slightly more than the minimum of three connections.

With a nominal amount of continuous activity (400 mutations/sec), our communications protocol can handle a maxmimum of 40 total connections.
