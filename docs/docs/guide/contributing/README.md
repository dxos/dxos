# Contributing to DXOS

\::: note
This section is under development
\:::

We welcome all your input! Our [mission](https://docs.dxos.org/guide/why) is to enable developers to build a fully decentralized alternative to the existing Cloud, and we believe the path ahead involves all kinds of developers from far and wide collaborating here. Thank you for being here and contributing.

## Submitting Issues

We love your input. Please submit an issue for any of these reasons:

*   Reporting a reproducible bug
*   Discussing the current state of the code
*   Proposing new features, ideas, or process

Some of these other needs are not best handled by github issues:

*   Asking a question about something not working -> StackOverflow tag #dxos
*   A security vulnerability or incident -> email security@braneframe.com directly. do NOT post anywhere else please.

## Setting up a developer environment

See the [Repository Guide](https://github.com/dxos/dxos/tree/main/REPOSITORY_GUIDE.md).

We welcome your pull requests:

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've added or changed APIs, update the JSDoc documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes `pnpm test`.
5.  Make sure your code lints `pnpm lint`.
6.  Create the pull request!
