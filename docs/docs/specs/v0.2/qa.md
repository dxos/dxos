# QA Script
This is the verification process to promote something from staging to production:

Use your normal, default profile in the browser, falling back to anonymous/guest profiles in case of a problem.

## Composer
- Launch app: [https://composer.staging.dxos.org](https://composer.staging.dxos.org)
- Create a space + document if necessary
- Click between documents, navigation should work
- Click invite on a space
  - scan the QR code with a mobile device
  - see that typing into a document replicates both ways
  - cursors should be present
  - selection highlights should be present

## Kai

- Launch app: [https://kai.staging.dxos.org](https://kai.staging.dxos.org)
- Create identity (first empty space should be autogenerated)
  - Set space name to "Test"
  - Generate test data (AppBar via menu)
  - Switch between visible frames
  - Add tasks and text in Stacks frame (create / update distinct objects)
  - Add lots of tasks in rapid succession (exercise a rate)
  - View tasks in Mosaic and Kanban frames (mosaic, kanban pages also load the same data)
- Click invite (from sidebar)
  - scan the QR code with a mobile device
  - See data replicated
- Go to Stacks frame (on both windows)
  - Type a bunch of random text quickly (on both sides) observe replication both ways
- Open Notes frame and create Note, drag it, observe replication both ways (exercises references)

## HALO
- [https://halo.staging.kube.dxos.org] - observe that the app loads
- invite a device to join, and give the invite code to a mobile device using an anonymous window. Observe that devices join the same halo and see the same spaces.

## CLI
- npm init @dxos@next (staging)
- pnpm install
- pnpm serve
- observe that the app loads and presents the "click to login" button
- login and use the counter, observe counter working between two windows

## Kube
- ensure a prod kube is running locally
- pnpm run deploy the app made with @dxos@next just now
- observe the app on [appname].localhost working
