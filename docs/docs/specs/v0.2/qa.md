# QA Script
This is the verification process to promote something from staging to production:

## Kai
### Guest profile:
Use a guest profile in the browser:

  - Set space name to "Test"
  - Generate test data (AppBar via menu)
  - Switch between visible frames (tabs)
  - Add tasks in Tasks frame (create / update distinct objects)
  - Add lots of tasks in rapid succession (exercise a rate)
  - View tasks in Mosaic and Kanban frames (mosaic, kanban pages also load the same data)
- Click invite (from sidebar)
  - scan the QR code with a mobile device

- Go to Documents frame (on both windows)
  - Type a bunch of random text quickly on one line (both sides)
