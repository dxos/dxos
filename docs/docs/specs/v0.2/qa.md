# QA Script

This is the verification process to promote something from staging to production:

Use your normal, default profile in the browser, falling back to anonymous/guest profiles in case of a problem.


## Composer

- Launch app: [https://composer.staging.dxos.org](https://composer.staging.dxos.org)
- Create a space + document if necessary
- Click between documents, navigation should work
- Click invite on a space
  - scan the QR code with a mobile device
  - see that typing into a document replicates both ways
  - cursors should be present
  - selection highlights should be present


## Kai

- Launch app: [https://kai.staging.dxos.org](https://kai.staging.dxos.org)
- Create identity (first empty space should be autogenerated)
  - Set space name to "Test"
  - Generate test data (AppBar via menu)
  - Switch between visible frames
  - Add tasks and text in Stacks frame (create / update distinct objects)
  - Add lots of tasks in rapid succession (exercise a rate)
  - View tasks in Mosaic and Kanban frames (mosaic, kanban pages also load the same data)
- Click invite (from sidebar)
  - scan the QR code with a mobile device
  - See data replicated
- Go to Stacks frame (on both windows)
  - Type a bunch of random text quickly (on both sides) observe replication both ways
- Open Notes frame and create Note, drag it, observe replication both ways (exercises references)


## HALO

- [https://halo.staging.kube.dxos.org] - observe that the app loads
- invite a device to join, and give the invite code to a mobile device using an anonymous window. Observe that devices join the same halo and see the same spaces.


## CLI

### Installation

- `npm init @dxos@next` (staging)
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm serve`
- observe that the app loads and presents the "click to login" button
- login and use the counter, observe counter working between two windows

> repeat the process with `dx app create` using `npm i -g @dxos/cli@next` (staging)

### HALO Invitations

1). Join two profiles:

```bash
# Reset identity:
export DX_PROFILE=test-1
dx agent stop
dx reset --force --no-agent
dx halo --no-agent create Test
dx halo --no-agent --json
# Copy Invitation code and PIN and enter in second profile below:
dx halo share

...

# List devices (2)
dx device list
```

2). Open a new profile in a separate window:

```bash
# Reset identity:
export DX_PROFILE=test-2
dx agent stop
dx reset --force --no-agent
# Enter Invitaiton code and PIN.
dx halo join

...

# List devices (2)
dx device list
```

3). Open KAI in a new/anonymous browser profile:
- Copy invitation code and PIN by running `dx halo share` again.
- Select create identity from authorized device:

4). Open Profile panel in KAI profile above:
- Create invitation.
- Run `dx halo join` in a third CLI profile.

```bash
# Reset identity:
export DX_PROFILE=test-3
dx agent stop
dx reset --force --no-agent
# Enter Invitaiton code and PIN.
dx halo join

...

# List devices (4)
dx device list
```

You should now see FOUR devices.


## Devtools and ECHO Proxy

```bash
export DX_PROFILE=test-1
dx agent stop
dx agent run --socket --ws=3456 --http=3000
```

- Open devtools and check identity: 
  https://devtools.dev.dxos.org?target=ws://localhost:3456
- Create a space and query the ECHO proxy:

```bash
dx space create
curl -i http://localhost:3000/spaces | jq
```


## KUBE

- ensure a prod kube is running locally
- pnpm run deploy the app made with @dxos@next just now
- observe the app on [appname].localhost working
