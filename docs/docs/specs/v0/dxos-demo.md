# DXOS Demo

We need an application we can use to demonstrate how quick and easy it is to assemble a real-time collaborative text-editor between two browser windows using a yjs compatible text editor and ECHO.

We also demonstrate the multi-model nature of ECHO by showing an ObjectModel with a TextModel working under a single interface together.
