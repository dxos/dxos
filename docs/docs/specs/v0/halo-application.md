# HALO Application

Setting up Identity in a decentralized context is hard. HALO offers a secure protocol for exchanging user identity information with applications in a privacy-preserving manner.

The HALO Application allows users to choose from a list of secure "identities" to use when interacting with an application, and helps the application authenticate the user. It's most similar to a "wallet" or a "password manager".

## Who is it for
`Developers` enjoy the application as a transparent part of the process to obtain a user identity.

End `users` use the application to manage secure "passwordless" sign-ins to the applications they use, revoke application access, or revoke device access to their identity and user data.

## User stories
Using the app, `users` can:
- self-identify when logging into an application (choose an identity)
- recover their halo / absorb it from another device
- discover and inspect the network
- join spaces
- send simple messages to each other after joining a space
- collaborate on a single per-space document together (like a readme or scratchpad)
- join HALO across multiple devices (including from dx CLI)
