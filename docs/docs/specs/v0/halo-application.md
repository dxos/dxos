# HALO Application

Setting up Identity in a decentralized context is hard. HALO offers a secure protocol for exchanging user identity information with applications in a privacy-preserving manner.

The HALO Application allows users to choose from a list of secure "identities" to use when interacting with an application, and helps the application authenticate the user. It's most similar to a "wallet" or a "password manager".

## Who is it for
`Developers` enjoy the application as a transparent part of the process to obtain a user identity.

End `users` use the application to manage secure "passwordless" sign-ins to the applications they use, revoke application access, or revoke device access to their identity and user data.

## Glossary
- user: a customer of an application built by a dxos developer
- developer: customer of the dxos platform, builds apps with dxos components
- profile: a list of properties found on a user object containing their name and avatar etc
- device: a particular instance of the dxos client (a browser / profile)
- application: a client identified by a hostname
