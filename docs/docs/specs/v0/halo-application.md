# HALO Application

Setting up Identity in a decentralized context is hard. HALO offers a secure protocol for exchanging user identity information with applications in a privacy-preserving manner.

The HALO Application allows users to choose from a list of secure "identities" to use when interacting with an application, and helps the application authenticate the user. It's most similar to a "wallet" or a "password manager".

## Who is it for
`Developers` enjoy the application as a transparent part of the process to obtain a user identity.

End `users` use the application to manage secure "passwordless" sign-ins to the applications they use, revoke application access, or revoke device access to their identity and user data.

## User stories

Using the app, `users` can:

self-identify
recover their halo / absorb it from another device
discover and inspect the network
join parties (spaces)
send simple messages to each other once in a space
create and collaborate on a list of strings in a space.
join HALO across multiple devices (including the CLI)
