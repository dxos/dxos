# QA Script
This is the verification process to promote something from staging to production:

## Kai
- Launch app: [https://kai.staging.kube.dxos.org](https://kai.staging.kube.dxos.org) in a dedicated Chrome profile
  - Reset everything (currently: Clear Cache extension)
- Create identity (first empty space should be autogenerated)
  - Set space name to "Test"
  - Generate test data (AppBar via menu)
  - Switch between visible frames (tabs)
  - Add tasks in Tasks frame (create / update distinct objects)
  - Add lots of tasks in rapid succession (exercise a rate)

  - Paste URL into side-by-side Incognito window and go through join sequence
  - See data replicated
- Go to Documents frame (on both windows)
  - Type a bunch of random text quickly on one line (both sides), then delete characters from another line; highlight and delete paragraph)
- Open Notes frame and create Note, drag it, observe replication both ways (exercises references)
