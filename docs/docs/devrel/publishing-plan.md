# Publishing Plan

**How DXOS works with the garage door up.**

**Plan in a nutshell:**

- Publish short form 2x/day on Twitter and Mastodon (same content)
- Publish blog posts on http://blog.dxos.org once per week
- Publish on the DXOS YouTubeÂ channel haphazardly

## Short-form Content (tweets, toots, etc)

### Categories / Templates

**Visual Demo**

- a visual demonstration of something in DXOS.
- format is a 15-90 second video in gif or mp4 format embedded in the tweet (not a link to YouTube).
- brief text describing it.
- optionally can include a thread about what's in the video.

Example: https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1683243208103346178

**Musings**

- a thread pondering an open-ended question or ruminating on a best practice.
- makes a case for a specific thing that we believe to be true about the world.
- can be a thread from one of the DXOS team members that is then retweeted by DXOS.

Example: https://twitter.com/jessmartin/status/1677336203085873152

**Announcement**

- announcement of something DXOS is shipping or some recent accomplishment.
- a thread that describes the announcement in detail.
- should also post this announcement in the Discord.
- if there is a related blog post, final post in the thread should probably link to a blog post.

Example: https://twitter.com/dxos_org/status/1673702469786804225

**Curation**

- retweet something that we think is awesome
- quote-tweet it to talk about why we think it's awesome

Example: https://twitter.com/dxos_org/status/1681694135483236353

**Technical Gem**

- deep-dive on a technical topic related to DXOS
- doesn't hide any of the technical detail
- demonstrates our technical mastery of our problem domain

Example: https://twitter.com/tldraw/status/1661038696630476801

**Build Out Loud**

- thread that walks through a story of building something, step-by-step, kind of a play-by-play of how a thing was built
- typically includes a healthy amount of screenshots
- links out to technologies used and related projects considered, etc
- ideally links to a place to play with the thing

Example: https://twitter.com/jessmartin/status/1646877737515208705
