## 1. Introduction

MESH is a set of protocols and components that enable resilient peer-to-peer networks.
The MESH infrastructure supports client application networks (e.g., parties), signaling, and server-to-server networks.

## 2. Terminology

***Discovery Key*** -
Public key used as the connection context for peers joining the swarm.

***Hypercore*** -
The [Hypercore protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org) is a peer-to-peer data replication mechanism build on top of signed append-only hash-linked logs.

***ICE*** -
The Interactive Connectivity Establishment ([ICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Connectivity_Establishment)) protocols enables peers (including applications running within a browser) to establish direct connections with each other.

***NAT*** -
Network Address Translation ([NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation)) provides a public IP address to devices behind a router.

***Party*** -
Context for collaboration and data replication.

***Peer*** -
Participant in a swarm. Each peer has a long-lived public key.

***Signaling*** -
Mechanism by which peers discovery each other and connect to a swarm.

***STUN*** -
The Session Traversal Utilities for NAT ([STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN)) is a protocol to discover your public address and determine any restrictions in your router that would prevent a direct connection with a peer.

***Swarm*** -
Transient peer-to-peer network of connected peers.

***TURN*** -
The Traversal Using Relays around NAT ([TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TURN)) server is used to relay data packets to bypass router restrictions if necessary.

***WebRTC*** -
The Web Real-Time Communications protocol ([WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Protocols)) API enables Javascript applications running within a browser to open peer-to-peer connections with each other. WebRTC uses the ICE protocols.

## 3. Basic Concepts

The MESH technologies enable resilient point-to-point and peer-to-peer communication between applications and system components.

### 3.1. RPC

> TODO(burdon): dxRPC.

### 3.2. Peer-to-Peer Swarms

Signaling enables two or more peers to discover and connect to each other to create a swarm.

<br/>

![Signaling](./diagrams/mesh-signaling-peers.drawio.svg)

Peers connect to a signaling server that helps orchestrate connections between peers.
Each signaling server maintains a map of peers that correspond to a swarm discovery key.
Signaling servers use a pubsub mechanism to share this state so that peers connected to remote signaling servers can discover other peers.

### 3.3. Applications

Peers may exist on multiple platforms including browsers, mobile applications, long-running Web services, and command line interfaces.

> *   TODO(burdon): Explain different topologies.

## 4. Signaling

Signaling hosts participate in a signaling network, and discover each other through libp2p's DHT, possibly bootstrapped only from other signaling hosts and/or kubes only.
They rendez-vous on a particular discovery key (CID) on the DHT, allowing for separate signaling networks on the same DHT.

The rest of exchanges happen over Pub/Sub.
Topics are namespaced between peer topics (messages of type `PeerEvent`), host topics (messages of type `HostEvent`), and swarm topics (messages of type `SwarmEvent`).

When a host announces the availability of a peer, it can request other peers in the swarm announce their presence back through its topic in order to allow for discovery while minimizing receptions.

All events and messages passing through the system are visible by anyone who can connect to the DHT.
Messages can be ciphered and/or signed; this is left as an application concern.
Peer to peer messages (unlike swarm events) could use point-to-point connections rather than Pub/Sub.

### 4.1. Protocol

The signal server implements the following dxRPC interface.

<!-- @code(../../packages/mesh/network-manager/src/proto/defs/dxos/mesh/signal.proto#Signal, link) -->

<sub>`@dxos/network-manager`[`[src/proto/defs/dxos/mesh/signal.proto]`](../../packages/mesh/network-manager/src/proto/defs/dxos/mesh/signal.proto)</sub>

```protobuf
option go_package = "github.com/dxos/kube/go/signal/pb";
service Signal {
  rpc Join(JoinRequest) returns (stream SwarmEvent);
  rpc ReceiveMessages(ReceptionRequest) returns (stream Message);
  rpc SendMessage(Message) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
}
```

### 4.2. Implementation

Each kube maintains:

*   as needed, a subscription to their own topic;
*   per local participant, lists of:
    *   swarm memberships with their announcement timeout (announcements must be broadcast periodically, and exits are
        made explicit whenever possible, including at kube soft shutdown);
    *   subscriptions for messages;
*   per swarm with local participants (with a grace period after disconnects so participants can reconnect smoothly):
    *   a subscription to the swarm's topic;
    *   a list of known participants, updated through announcements and their expiries;

The sequence diagram below illustrates communications between peers.
This omits STUN/TURN to focus on communications between peers, their signaling services, and the signaling network.

![Diagram of a P2P connection](diagrams/puml/mesh-signal-multi-host-join.svg)

1.  *Prelude: Bob joins.* Bob is already listening for their messages, and has joined `s0`.

2.  *Alice's arrival.* Upon arrival, Alice subscribes to receive her messages. She joins `s0`.
    This causes the kube to request announces back, and the family's kube announces back Bob.
    This also causes the kube to announce her, which gets to Bob.

3.  *Messaging.* As Alice initiates a connection with Bob, she sends a message to him.
    Further messages might be exchanged between Alice and Bob through their respective kubes and topics.

4.  *Alice's departure.*
    Later, Alice leaves the swarm.
    This leads her kube to announce her departure,
    letting Bob's kube refresh its swarm membership table such that future joiners do not discover her immediately,
    and notifying Bob of her departure immediately.
    Because Alice was the last active member of `s0` on her kube, it unsubscribes from `s0`.
    Because it no longer needs to receive lookup responses, it unsubscribes from `akube`.

5.  Charlie joins the family's kube.

6.  *Bob's re-broadcast.*
    After a while, Bob's kube reannounces Bob's swarm membership such that any kube's swarm membership table considers it
    fresh enough to be discovered by incoming clients and not announced as having left to existing ones.

7.  *Bob's departure.*
    Eventually, Bob gets disconnected from their kube. After a timeout, Bob's kube proceeds to announce the departure to
    the network and Charlie, and unsubscribe from their peer events.

8.  *The family kube shuts down.*
    Client streams are closed and topics unsubscribed from. Departures are announced.

## 5. Data Replication

> *   TODO(burdon): Reference ECHO design.

## 6. Issues

> *   How is data from a connected peer multiplexed into multiple hypercores (if the swarm is not fully connected)? How does bi-directionality work?
> *   Reference HALO authentication/party admission.
> *   Reference ECHO `hypercore`, `@dxos/protocol` replication; [Noise](https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html)?
> *   <https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/hypercore-protocol>
> *   <https://github.com/mafintosh/simple-hypercore-protocol/blob/master/schema.proto>
> *   <https://github.com/dat-ecosystem-archive/whitepaper/blob/master/dat-paper.pdf>
> *   Legacy [simple-peer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-peer) WebRTC library.
> *   Migrate to [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/specs) DHT/Pubsub; need to resolve deprecated star

> *   Current [signaling protocol design](https://github.com/dxos/dxos/issues/1316). Incl. WebRTC protocol data (SIP, network interfacte, IP addr, STUN/TURN)? protocol.
> *   MST swarm/routing.
> *   Scope of replication for signaling servers (i.e., subnet/realm vs. global DXNS network?) Security considerations. Peers configured with multiple signal servers (one per network)?
> *   Implement general purpose message streaming between peers? (e.g., beyond signaling/discovery, iniitation of party invitations).
> *   Generalize discovery key to generic network assets (i.e., not just party)? E.g., discovery of peers based on agent identity (public key).
> *   Guaranteed message delivery (or just ACK)? AXE for reliable streams? QUIC, SPDY?
> *   Presence management (separate from in-party swarm presence?)
> *   Security considerations (e.g., encryption, authentication, key exchange, hash party/device keys, TTLs)
