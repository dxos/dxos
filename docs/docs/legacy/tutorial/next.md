Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You've completed the DXOS full-stack tutorial.
You're now ready to dive into each individual part of the DXOS platform.

Let's review what we've covered:

- How to create a basic app by creating an instance of `Client`, creating the user profile, and creating parties.
- The React hooks which provide convenient access to the ECHO database.
- The mechanism for inviting peers to enable peer-to-peer collaboration.

Please take the time to learn more about the DXOS capabilities and come up with new ideas for apps that share content. As you have seen, it's fast and easy to construct those apps using DXOS.

You can find all the code for this tutorial on this Github [@dxos/tutorial-tasks-app](https://github.com/dxos/tutorial-tasks-app) repository.

After this section, we recommend moving on to:

- [Deployment](../publishing/configuration): Learn how to make your app public for anyone on the Internet.
