description: Walkthrough of how to build a Composer plugin
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This tutorial will walk through the creation of a plugin which introduces a new data type and integrates it with other core plugins.
The plugin used as an example here is Composer's [map plugin](https://github.com/dxos/dxos/tree/main/packages/plugins/plugin-map).
Each section below will explain a different [`PluginModule`](/composer/introduction#pluginmodule), its [`ActivationEvent`](/composer/introduction#activationevent), the [`Capability`](/composer/introduction#capability) it contributes and how that fits within the greater context of the application.

## Translations

Most of the core functionality of Composer comes ready of internationalization.
Today, most plugins only provide English translations, however the pattern of translation strings also makes it easier to adjust the language of a plugin as it evolves.
While not strictly required, it is recommended to implement user-facing strings in your application using translation resources.

```ts
// MapPlugin.ts
// ...
defineModule({
  id: `${meta.id}/module/translations`,
  // This activation event is fired by the theme plugin when it is initalizing the translations provider.
  activatesOn: Events.SetupTranslations,
  activate: () => contributes(Capabilities.Translations, translations),
}),
// ...
```

These translations are collected by the core [theme plugin](https://github.com/dxos/dxos/tree/main/packages/plugins/plugin-theme) which uses [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) under the hood, so here `translations` is an array of i18next resources:

```ts
// translations.ts
export const translations = [
  {
    'en-US': {
      // Most translations provided by plugins use the plugin id as the namespace.
      [MapPlugin.meta.id]: {
        'plugin name': 'Maps',
        'toggle type label': 'Toggle view',
      },
      // Translations that are provided for other plugins to lookup are often keyed by the schema typename.
      [Map.Map.typename]: {
        'typename label': 'Map',
        'object title placeholder': 'New map',
      },
    },
  },
] as const;
```

## Intents

Intents are a way for plugins to communicate with each other.
They represent an abstract description of an operation to be performed, and allow those operations to be initiated by any plugin.
Intents have typed inputs and outputs as well as a string identifier and are constructed as an [Effect Schema](https://effect.website/docs/schema/introduction/) `TaggedClass`:

```ts
// types/types.ts
// ...
export namespace MapAction {
  const MAP_ACTION = `${MapPlugin.meta.id}/action`;

  export class Create extends Schema.TaggedClass<Create>()(
    `${MAP_ACTION}/create`,
    {
      input: Schema.extend(
        Schema.Struct({
          space: SpaceSchema,
          coordinates: Schema.optional(GeoPoint),
        }),
        MapAction.CreateMap,
      ),
      output: Schema.Struct({ object: Map.Map }),
    },
  ) {}

  export class Toggle extends Schema.TaggedClass<Toggle>()(
    `${MAP_ACTION}/toggle`,
    {
      input: Schema.Void,
      output: Schema.Void,
    },
  ) {}
}
// ...
```

Alongside the intent definitions the capability that a plugin will contribute is an [`IntentResolver`](/typedoc/app-framework/types/IntentResolver.html).

```ts
// MapPlugin.ts
// ...
defineModule({
  id: `${meta.id}/module/intent-resolver`,
  // This activation event is fired by the intent plugin when it is initalizing the global intent resolver.
  activatesOn: Events.SetupIntentResolver,
  activate: IntentResolver,
}),
// ...
```

```ts
// intent-resolver.ts
export default (context: PluginsContext) =>
  contributes(Capabilities.IntentResolver, [
    createResolver({
      intent: MapAction.Create,
      resolve: async ({
        space,
        name,
        coordinates,
        initialSchema,
        locationProperty,
      }) => {
        const { map } = await initializeMap({
          space,
          name,
          coordinates,
          initialSchema,
          locationProperty,
        });
        return {
          data: { object: map },
        };
      },
    }),
    createResolver({
      intent: MapAction.Toggle,
      resolve: () => {
        const state = context.requestCapability(MapCapabilities.MutableState);
        state.type = state.type === 'globe' ? 'map' : 'globe';
      },
    }),
  ]);
```

## Schema

In order to be able to create objects of a given type, the plugin must contribute the schema to the application.
For user-facing schemas this is done through the `SpaceCapabilities.ObjectForm` capability.

```ts
// MapPlugin.ts
// ...
defineModule({
  id: `${meta.id}/module/object-form`,
  // This activation event is fired by the client plugin after the client has been initialized when schemas are being registered.
  activatesOn: ClientEvents.SetupSchema,
  activate: () => contributes(ClientCapabilities.Schema, [Map.Map]),
}),
// ...
```

## Metadata

The metadata capability allows an arbitrary record of metadata to be stored for any key.
The most common use case for this in Composer today is storing render information (e.g. icons) for different types of ECHO objects.
In such cases the key for the metadata is the schema typename.

An optional `formSchema` can be provided if the object has properties which may need to be configured on creation.
The `createObjectIntent` function returns the intent to be used in order to create new objects via the object creation dialog.

```ts
// MapPlugin.ts
// ...
defineModule({
  id: `${meta.id}/module/metadata`,
  // This activation event is fired by the metadata plugin when it is collecting metadata.
  activatesOn: Events.SetupMetadata,
  activate: () =>
    contributes(Capabilities.Metadata, {
      id: Map.Map.typename,
      metadata: {
        icon: 'ph--compass--regular',
        formSchema: MapAction.CreateMap, // Optional.
        createObjectIntent: ((props, options) =>
          createIntent(MapAction.Create, { ...props, space: options.space })) satisfies CreateObjectIntent,
      },
    }),
}),
// ...
```

<Aside type="note">
If you want the object to be added to a collection when it is created, you can set the `addToCollectionOnCreate` property to `true`.

```ts
{
  icon: 'ph--compass--regular',
  formSchema: MapAction.CreateMap,
  createObjectIntent: ((props, options) =>
    createIntent(MapAction.Create, { ...props, space: options.space })) satisfies CreateObjectIntent,
  addToCollectionOnCreate: true,
}
```

## Surfaces

A Surface is a component which allows one plugin to delegate rendering of a subtree to another plugin.
This mechanism is analogous to an `Outlet` in React Router except there the tree of routes is generally combined statically by the app developer.
With a Surface there's a layer of indirection which allows for different plugins to be swapped in and out or even be combined.

When defining a Surface it must be given a role and is generally passed some sort of data.
The role can be thought of as analogous to ARIA roles, but broader and without a strictly defined set.
They indicate to other plugins what is expected to be rendered in a Surface.
The data is a javascript object where the values are information that is expected to be used in the rendering of the Surface.
At runtime this role and data are passed into the Surface and what happens next is that the Surface is resolved to a component from another plugin.
This resolution mechanism is controlled by the SurfacePlugin.

```ts
// MapPlugin.ts
// ...
defineModule({
  id: `${meta.id}/module/react-surface`,
  // This activation event is currently fired by app framework on startup.
  activatesOn: Events.SetupReactSurface,
  activate: ReactSurface,
}),
// ...
```

```ts
// react-surface.ts
export default () =>
  contributes(Capabilities.ReactSurface, [
    createSurface({
      id: `${MapPlugin.meta.id}/map`,
      // The article role is used by planks in the deck.
      // The section role is used by items in a stack.
      role: ['article', 'section'],
      filter: (data): data is { subject: Map.Map } => Obj.instanceOf(Map.Map, data.subject),
      component: ({ data, role }) => {
        const state = useCapability(MapCapabilities.MutableState);
        const [lng = 0, lat = 0] = data.subject?.coordinates ?? [];
        const [center, setCenter] = useState<LatLngLiteral>({ lat, lng });
        const [zoom, setZoom] = useState(14);

        const handleChange = useCallback(({ center, zoom }: { center: LatLngLiteral; zoom: number }) => {
          setCenter(center);
          setZoom(zoom);
        }, []);

        return (
          <MapContainer
            role={role}
            type={state.type}
            map={data.subject}
            center={center}
            zoom={zoom}
            onChange={handleChange}
          />
        );
      },
    }),
    createSurface({
      id: `${MapPlugin.meta.id}/settings`,
      // The complementary--settings role is used by the surface in the deck's complementary sidebar.
      // The second part of the role denotes the panel of the sidebar that the surface is in.
      role: 'complementary--settings',
      filter: (data): data is { subject: Map.Map } => Obj.instanceof(Map.Map, data.subject),
      component: ({ data }) => <MapViewEditor map={data.subject} />,
    }),
    // ...
  ]);
```

## App Graph

The app graph is a contract for UIs which present, organize and navigate over a graph of the user's knowledge.
It enables any kind of navigation UI such as trees, lists, accordions, force-directed layouts, etc. and allow them to source their content & structure from plugins.
The app graph allows plugins to collaborate on building out the navigational structure of an application without a priori knowledge of each other.

The way the graph is constructed is via reactively executing builder extensions of which there are currently two types: connectors and resolvers.
Connectors take an existing node as an input and return nodes which should be connected to that node while resolvers take a string identifier as an input and return a node based on that unique id.
Connectors are useful for lazily expanding the graph based on navigation throughout the app. Early app graph implementations eagerly expanded the whole graph on app load which was very heavy.

Resolvers have a couple different uses right now. The first is that if a node can be resolved directly then it can also be cached, allowing key parts of the graph to be cached and quickly hydrated on initial app load.
Resolvers are also used to directly resolve a known node which may or may not be connected into the rest of the graph later. This can also help improve perceived performance where you can directly resolve a node rather than building out the graph to it when opening a document on load.

```ts
// MapPlugin.ts
// ...
defineModule({
  id: `${meta.id}/module/app-graph-builder`,
  // This activation event is fired by the graph plugin when it is initalizing the app graph builder.
  activatesOn: Events.SetupAppGraph,
  activate: AppGraphBuilder,
}),
// ...
```

The map plugin's graph builder adds a toggle action to any graph node which represents a `Map` object.

```ts
// app-graph-builder.ts
export default (context: PluginsContext) =>
  contributes(
    Capabilities.AppGraphBuilder,
    createExtension({
      id: MapAction.Toggle._tag,
      filter: (node): node is Node<Map.Map> => Obj.instanceOf(Map.Map, node.data),
      actions: () => {
        return [
          {
            id: `${MapPlugin.meta.id}/toggle`,
            data: async () => {
              const { dispatchPromise: dispatch } = context.requestCapability(
                Capabilities.IntentDispatcher,
              );
              await dispatch(createIntent(MapAction.Toggle));
            },
            properties: {
              label: ['toggle type label', { ns: MapPlugin.meta.id }],
              icon: 'ph--compass--regular',
            },
          },
        ];
      },
    }),
  );
```

## Artifact

An `ArtifactDefinition` is an abstraction for describing how to programatically interact with a data type.
This includes a description of artifact, its schema, instructions for how to use the artifact and a list of tools which can be used to act on the artifact.

```ts
// MapPlugin.ts
// ...
defineModule({
  id: `${meta.id}/module/artifact-definition`,
  // This activation event is fired by the assistant plugin when it is initalizing an ai chat.
  activatesOn: Events.SetupArtifactDefinition,
  activate: ArtifactDefinition,
}),
// ...
```

The map plugin's artifact definition adds a tool to the ai chat which allows the user to list all maps in the current space.

```ts
// artifact-definition.ts
export default () => {
  const definition = defineArtifact({
    id: meta.id,
    name: meta.name,
    instructions: `
      - If the request relates to a map, you must return the map as a valid GeoJSON Point (longitude, latitude) with valid coordinates.
      - If the request relates to a collection of points (like in a table) you can specify the typename and the map will render and center on those markers.
      - If the request generates a table with GeoJSON point, provide a suggestion to the user to view on a map.
    `,
    schema: Map.Map,
    tools: [
      createTool(meta.id, {
        name: 'list',
        description: 'Query maps.',
        caption: 'Listing maps...',
        schema: Schema.Struct({}),
        execute: async (_, { extensions }) => {
          invariant(extensions?.space, 'No space');
          const { objects } = await extensions.space.db
            .query(Filter.type(Map.Map))
            .run();
          invariant(objects.length > 0, 'No maps found');
          return ToolResult.Success(objects);
        },
      }),
      // ...
    ],
  });

  return contributes(Capabilities.ArtifactDefinition, definition);
};
```
