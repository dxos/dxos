This section describes how to obtain [HALO identity](/halo/introduction) in `react`.

## Obtaining identity

The user's identity can be obtained by a react application with the `useIdentity` hook:

<Code code={useIdentity.slice(34)} lang="tsx" />

The object returned is of type `Identity`.

<Aside type="note" title="Identity hook">
  When first creating an identity, the `useIdentity` hook will fire twice. Once with `null`, and then again with an identity when one has been established.
</Aside>

Once identity is established, a [`space`](/echo/react/api) must be created or joined in order to manipulate data.
