import writeItems from './snippets/write-items.ts?raw';
import createObjects from './snippets/create-objects.ts?raw';
import createObjectsTyped from './snippets/create-objects-typed.ts?raw';

Objects returned from `query` are automatically tracked by the `Client` and direct manipulation of them will result in writes being dispatched over the network to listening peers in the space.

<Code code={writeItems.slice(34)} lang="ts" />

The mutation will queue up inside the `Client` and begin propagating to listening peers on the next tick.

## Creating objects

To insert an object into an ECHO space, simply construct it and call the `add` method to begin tracking it.

### Untyped

Without strong types, the generic `Expando` class can be used:

<Code code={createObjects.slice(34)} lang="ts" />

### Typed

If strong types are desired, an instance of a specific `TypedObject` descendant should be used:

<Code code={createObjectsTyped.slice(34)} lang="ts" />

## Removing objects

To remove an object (typed or untyped) call the `remove` API on a space.

```ts
space.db.remove(object);
```

<Aside type="note">
Objects in ECHO are not physically deleted, they are marked with a removed field and remain in the change history until the next [epoch](/additional-resources/glossary#epoch). This ECHO mutation feed design is required to allow any latent offline writers to reconcile changes when they come online.
