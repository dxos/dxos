Mutating objects in [ECHO](/echo/introduction) is as simple as directly manipulating them like normal JavaScript objects.

When an object comes out of an [ECHO](/echo/introduction) query, it is tracked by framework and any changes to it will be issued to the peer network and applied to all connected clients reactively. Other clients see their `useQuery` hooks and query subscriptions fire when the changes come in.

## Untyped Mutations

### Setting values

In the example below, clicking a task sets `completed = true`.

{/* TODO(burdon): Replace with better example. */}
<Code code={createObject.slice(34)} lang="tsx" />

### Creating objects

To create (insert) a new object, simply construct a `new Expando` and pass any initial values into the constructor.

<Aside type="note">
Calling `space.db.add(task)` needs to happen only once. All changes to the object afterwards will be tracked by ECHO.
</Aside>

## Typed Mutations

The following example uses the same schema definition as in the [Typed Queries](/echo/react/queries#typed-queries) section.

### Setting values

In the example below, clicking a task sets `completed = true` in the same way as the untyped API.

<Code code={createObjectTyped.slice(34)} lang="tsx" />

### Creating objects

To create (insert) a new object, construct a new one with the `create` function and pass any initial values in.

## Removing objects

To remove an object (typed or untyped) call the `remove` API on a space.

```ts
space.db.remove(task);
```

<Aside type="note">
Objects in ECHO are not physically deleted, they are marked with a removed field and remain in the change history until the next [epoch](/additional-resources/glossary#epoch). This ECHO mutation feed design is required to allow any latent offline writers to reconcile changes when they come online.
