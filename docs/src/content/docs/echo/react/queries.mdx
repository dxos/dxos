import schema from './snippets/schema.ts?raw';

The simplest way to access data in [`ECHO`](/echo/introduction) from `react` is by using a `useQuery` hook on a [`space`](/additional-resources/glossary#space). This will return generic objects which can be [mutated](/echo/react/mutations) like regular JavaScript objects. `useQuery<T>` can also return strongly typed results as will be shown [below](#typed-queries).

## Untyped queries

The first argument to `useQuery` from package `@dxos/react-client` is the [`space`](/additional-resources/glossary#space) and the second is an optional filter which matches all objects which have all the keys and values specified in the filter. The return type is an iterable array of `Document` objects.

<Code code={useQuery.slice(34)} lang="tsx" />

`useQuery` returns a generic `TypedObject` type which supports the ability to set and read arbitrary keys and values. See [below](#typed-queries) for how to add type safety.

## Typed Queries

It's possible to obtain strongly typed objects from `useQuery`.

Because `useQuery` returns tracked ECHO objects, their type must descend from `TypedObject`.

DXOS provides apis to define these types using [Effect Schema](https://effect.website).

Ability to generate type-safe data access code, which makes development faster and safer.
</Aside>

Consider this expression of schema declared with Effect Schema:

<Code code={schema.slice(34)} lang="ts" />

Types can be used to make queries as well:

<Code code={useQueryTyped.slice(34)} lang="tsx" />

Note the `client.addTypes` call which registers the types with the client.
