# Upgrading moon: https://moonrepo.dev/docs/install#upgrading
# NOTE: Moon is also included in the npm packages at the repo root.
#  This is only for compability purposes (i.e., supporting Cloudflare Pages deploys).
#  It is expected that developers will be using moon via proto, but they should be kept in sync.
# NOTE: Make sure those versions match!
