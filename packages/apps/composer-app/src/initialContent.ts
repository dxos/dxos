Thank you for trying DXOS Composer. 

Here, you can:
- Create and organize things
- Share and collaborate with others in real-time
- Work offline

Composer is:
- Free. Software built with DXOS requires no expensive server infrastructure to operate.
- Private. Your data never travels to or lives on any servers. Connections with collaborators are peer-to-peer.
- Local-first. Your data is stored entirely in your browser.
- Extensible. Add features by building plugins.
- Open source.

Your feedback is most welcome: feature requests, bug reports, questions: [Discord](https://discord.gg/uTYyx6srAW)

- [DXOS Documentation](https://docs.dxos.org) where you can build your own local-first, collaborative software.
