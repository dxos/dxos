Composer is now in Beta and regular updates will be published to the new site 
:link[composer.space]{href="https://composer.space"}.

Composer will remain free to use; we are still 100% committed to building privacy-preserving open source software.
However, we are asking Beta users to sign-up and give us feedback to help us build Composer during this next stage of development.

You will be able to transfer your existing data by initiating a
:link[device invitation]{href="https://docs.dxos.org/guide/platform/halo.html#device-invitations"}.
Please click the Sign-up button below to register for the Beta.

If you have questions or comments, please join our :link[Discord]{href="https://discord.gg/eXVfryv3sW"}.
Thanks for your support!
