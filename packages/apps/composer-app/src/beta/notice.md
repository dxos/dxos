The new location at :link[composer.space]{href="https://composer.space"} gives Composer its own home, and reflects our commitment to an open, extensible, and privacy-preserving knowledge space for everyone.

To help us stay in touch with your feedback, we are asking you to sign-up with an email at :link[composer.space]{href="https://composer.space"} and migrate your data by performing a :link[device invitation]{href="https://docs.dxos.org/guide/platform/halo.html#device-invitations"} from this version of the app to the new one.

Composer will remain free to use; we are committed to building privacy-preserving, open source software.

This app at `composer.dxos.org` will eventually be sunset in favor of :link[composer.space]{href="https://composer.space"}, please don't wait to migrate your data.

If you have questions or comments, please join our :link[Discord]{href="https://dxos.org/discord"}.

Thanks for your support!
