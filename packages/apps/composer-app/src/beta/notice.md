Composer is now in Beta and going forward updates will be published to the new site 
:link[composer.space]{href="https://composer.space"}.

Composer will remain free to use and we are still 100% committed to building privacy-preserving open source software.

However, we're asking Beta users to sign-up to help us build Composer during this next stage of development.

Please click the Sign-up button below to register for the Beta.

To transfer your data, you will be able to transfer your existing data by initiating a
