# Logos and image assets

NOTE: We tried "@vite-pwa/assets-generator", but it isn't fully implemented; pwa-asset-generator is also out of date.

Instead, use https://realfavicongenerator.net with the 512x512 transparent icon.

Run the following to generate the Windows icon.

```bash
pnpm run icons:mstile
```
