## Development

To run the app with HALO.

```bash
pnpm -w nx run composer-app:serve-with-vault
```

## Native Bundling

The app can be bundled to native apps using [Socket Supply, Co.](https://socketsupply.co/) (SSC).

SSC needs to be installed globally:

`npm i @socketsupply/socket -g`

Before running SSC, Composer must be built using:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8192
pnpm nx bundle composer-app
```

Then, to bundle the native app, in this directory, run:

`ssc build -r`

This will bundle the app and open it.

To open the app:

`open build/mac/composer-dev.app`

To run against the vite dev server:

```bash
pnpm nx serve-with-vault composer-app
ssc build -r --port 5173
```
To reset the app, inspect and delete local storage properties.
