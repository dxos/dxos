# HALO

HALO is a system of components for implementing decentralized identity designed around privacy, security, and collaboration requirements.

- The HALO application is a software wallet that contains user identities, their secrets (i.e., private keys) and other credentials.
- The HALO SDK is part of the DXOS client library and provides user authentication, profile, and contact management capabilities.
- The HALO protocol supports the verification, transport, and exchange of identity information between networked peers.
