# @dxos/composer-extension

```bash
pnpm -w nx serve composer-extension
```

Set `TARGET=firefox` to run in Firefox.

## Browser Profiles

Since testing this extension requires one to be authenticated with Github, `web-ext` is configured to persist the browser profiles.
These are located in `.profiles` relative to the package directory.
