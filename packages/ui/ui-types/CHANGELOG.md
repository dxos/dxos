### Minor Changes

- ed992c2: Remove `className` from `ComposableProps`, so `classNames` is the only styling prop a consumer may
  pass to a composable or slottable component. Accepting both gave every part two indistinguishable
  props, and a part that destructured one while spreading the other silently dropped the caller's
  classes. Passing `className` to such a component is now a compile error; rename it to `classNames`.
  Radix `Slot` still injects `className` at runtime — implementations receive it through
  `HTMLAttributes` and `composableProps` merges it, so slotted composition is unchanged.
