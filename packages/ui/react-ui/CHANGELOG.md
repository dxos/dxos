# @dxos/react-ui

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- d958118: Inbox draft composer rebuilt as a compose-style form, plus the shared UI it needs. `@dxos/react-ui` `Input.TextInput` gains MUI-style `start`/`end` adornments rendered inside the input container; `@dxos/ui-theme` adds a shared `.dx-input` box treatment (surface + hairline border + focus-within shift) now used by Input, `MarkdownField`, `RefEditor`, and the inbox editor. `@dxos/react-ui-form` `RefEditor` email mode renders committed mailboxes as atomic tag widgets (trailing delete affordance, no `@` marker) — a raw address stays plain text until committed with comma/Space/Enter, typing before a tag starts a fresh token, and the single line is centered so text and tags align. `@dxos/ui-editor`'s `defaultThemeSlots` is now `fullWidth` (no longer forces `h-full`). `@dxos/plugin-inbox` `EditMessage` gains To/Cc/Bcc recipient pickers with Person autocomplete, arrow-key field navigation, and a layout fix so Send no longer overlaps the editor.

### Patch Changes

- e0e1a9f: Supporting changes for the new plugin-blogger / plugin-typefully feature:
  - **@dxos/plugin-connector**: expose `Connection` types via a new `./types` export subpath so provider plugins can consume the connection contract without pulling the full package barrel.
  - **@dxos/react-ui**: `Card.Root` now accepts and forwards `onKeyDown`, enabling keyboard-interactive cards (Enter/Space activation) without a cast.

- 2fe5a7a: `useThemeContext` no longer throws when no `ThemeProvider` is mounted; it falls back to the default theme (with a one-time warning) so error-reporting surfaces such as the fatal dialog remain renderable.
- 717edc0: `MediaPlayer` now honors an explicit `kind` prop for native playback of extensionless sources (e.g. `blob:`/`data:` URLs), instead of falling back to an `<img>` when the URL has no recognized media extension.
