// Party Credentials are messages that, by virtue of their being signed by a key that is a
// recognized authority, convey to the recipient that something should be allowed or done.
// They are therefore similar in structure and purpose to X.509 certificates and to W3C
// Verifiable Credentials. The "subject" for a Party Credential (who or what can do the thing allowed),
// along with the kind of action permitted is specified in one of the four contained message
// types: PartyGenesis, FeedGenesis, KeyAdmit, FeedAdmit. One such subject message is
// present in the contents field of each PartyCredential message.
// PartyMessage carries common metadata (created, nonce) and the type of the subject message (type).
// Note that the subject message type is explicitly present in the type field even though
// its type will be discoverable via the relevant codec at runtime. This arrangement allows
// for signing to be done over the relevant fields (fields for which signature inclusion is
// necessary to ensure the security of the system), without needing to make assumptions about
// the presence and specific form of the codec-supplied message type identification.
// The complete credential comprises the PartyCredential message contents, signed by the
// relevant authority key(s), encoded as a SignedMessage (see ../signed.proto).

// received from another node that is not yet a party member (invitee), to be published on the party on behalf
// of that node by another node (greeter). It thereby provides a kind of delegated authority mechanism used to
// link signatures across the two nodes in a replay and impersonation resistant manner.

// its key, a message provided to it, signed by the Invitee, to the Party, via the greeting node's feed.

// those of the Invitee, demonstrating ownership by the Invitee of the keys or feeds to be admitted.
// Envelope exists solely to include the party key under the countersignature, otherwise two nested SignedMessages
// could be used. The party key is included to prevent replay attacks where a valid credential from one
// party is used to gain access to a different party.
