/**
 * A locking mechanism to ensure that a given section of the code is executed by only one single "thread" at a time.
 *
 * Functions are chained in a structure similar to a linked list.
 * `_lastPromise` always contains the function that will finish executing last.
 *
 * Initially it is set to `Promise.resolve()` -- a promise that resolves immediately.
 * Enqueuing is done by attaching provided function to the `_lastPromise` via a `.then()` call
 * then updating the `_lastPromise` variable.
 *
 * It is important that enqueuing is done atomically:
 * there are no `await`s in `executeSynchronized` and it's not async while still returning a promise.
 *
 * Java docs reference on synchronized sections:
 * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/locksync.html
