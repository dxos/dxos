/**

 * They initiate a connection with any new peer if they are not currently in the invitation flow
 * with another peer (connected.length > 0).
 * When the invitation flow ends guest leaves the swarm and topology is updated once again,
 * so we can connect to the next peer we haven't tried yet.
 * If the peer turns out to be a host or a malicious guest their ID is remembered so that we don't try
 * to establish a connection with them again.
 *
 * Guests don't initiate connections. They accept all connections because if we reject,
 * the host won't retry their offer.
 * Even if we started an invitation flow with one host we might want to try other hosts in case
 * the first one failed due to a network error, so multiple connections are accepted.
