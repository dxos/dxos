# Purpose

A DXOS remote agent runs continuously to provide backup and replication functionality.

# Preparation

1. Choose a server to run the remote agent on. You may run it on Digital Ocean Droplet using the instructions below, or on an existing server.

If you use an existing server, you will need to ensure it matches the requirements below and will be responsible for the installation of the DXOS cli and administration of the underlying operating system.

Requirements for an existing server:
- The server needs to run macOS or Linux
- This server should run continuously and have a stable Internet connection.
- The server and not run other heavy workloads
- You will need to know how to operate the server's package manager (e.g. Homebrew or APT) and ensure that the CLI can run continously

2. Have an existing DXOS identity and DXOS spaces that you want to replicate onto the agent.
