Basic observability data will be sent to the DXOS team in order to improve the product. This includes
performance metrics, error logs, and usage data. No personally identifiable information, other than your
public key, is included with this data and no private data ever leaves your devices.
To disable sending observability data, set the environment variable `DX_DISABLE_OBSERVABILITY=true`.
