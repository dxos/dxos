# @dxos/mcp-server

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- e094f74: The MCP server projects a fixed three-tool surface — `queryOperations`, `invokeOperation` and `loadSkill` — instead of one tool per operation, so the advertised tool surface stays fixed however many operations a host registers (an unfiltered `queryOperations` response still grows with the registry, but it is fetched on demand rather than loaded into every session), and the surface is backed directly by ECHO's `Registry` holding `PersistentOperation` and `Skill` entities. **Breaking:** operations are no longer advertised as MCP tools — a client calls `queryOperations` to search them (text queries evaluate through the registry's `Filter.text`; a `keys` lookup returns input/output JSON Schemas) and `invokeOperation` to run one — and the `McpRegistry` namespace is removed: hosts now provide echo's `Registry.Service` plus the new `McpServer.Host` (invoke seam and session spaces), with `McpServer.hydrateRegistry` building a registry from wire records for RPC-backed hosts. `loadSkill` lists every skill when called with no argument, and per-operation safety hints moved from tool annotations to the `mutation` field of a `queryOperations` row.
- c649575: Add `@dxos/mcp-server`, the MCP tool and prompt surface projected from the operation registry, and `dx mcp serve`, which runs it locally over stdio against the active profile's identity and spaces — the same surface the deployed server exposes.
- 63e500b: Space object CRUD is now projected from operations, and space operations no longer reach for app
  plugins to do it.

  `addObject`, `getObject`, `updateObject`, `removeObjects` and `queryObjects` are MCP-projected
  operations, so a remote agent reads and writes space objects through the same verbs the app uses.
  `addObject` takes one `object` field that is a union of a live entity and a `{ "@type", ...props }`
  description, so the schema itself admits exactly one form rather than two optional fields policed by
  a handler check; `removeObjects` accepts references alongside live entities,
  and space operations no longer require a capability manager they never use — both so a host without
  the app's UI capabilities can still invoke them.

  Observability events are registered rather than emitted. A plugin contributes an
  `ObservabilityMapping` — the operation, the event name, and how to derive the event's properties
  from the invocation's input and output — through the new `Capabilities.ObservabilityMapping`, and
  plugin-observability listens to the operation invocation stream and sends the event, exactly as undo
  derives an inverse from an `UndoMapping`. `Create`, `Share`, `Migrate`, `AddObject` and `AddType`
  no longer invoke `ObservabilityOperation.SendEvent` themselves, `SpacePlugin`'s `observability`
  option now decides whether the mappings are registered, and `SpaceOperationConfig.observability` is
  removed as a result.

  Skills move to the plugins that own their subject. `@dxos/plugin-connector` now owns the
  `connectors` skill (import `ConnectorsSkill` from it; enabling ConnectorPlugin contributes it), and
  `@dxos/plugin-space` owns the **Database** skill — object CRUD over the projected verbs, exported as
  `DatabaseSkill` from `@dxos/plugin-space/DatabaseSkill`.

  `@dxos/assistant-toolkit`'s own database skill is now chat-context binding alone
  (`contextAdd`/`contextRemove`), so it is renamed: `ChatContextSkill`, keyed `org.dxos.skill.chatContext`,
  exporting `ChatContextHandlers` and `ChatContextOperations`. The `org.dxos.skill.database` key goes
  with the verbs to plugin-space's Database skill, so a chat already bound to it keeps reading and
  writing objects. Everything else either moved to
  plugin-space or was retired as a duplicate: `objectCreate`, `objectDelete`, `objectUpdate`, `query`
  and `load` are covered by the projected verbs; `relationDelete` by `removeObjects`, which already
  accepts relations; `tagAdd`, `tagRemove` and `schemaList` moved as the annotated `addTag`,
  `removeTag` and `queryTypes`; and `relationCreate` and `schemaAdd` merged into plugin-space's
  existing `addRelation` and `addType`, each gaining the described form (a typename, references, or a
  JSON Schema) beside the live one, so the same verb serves an in-process and a remote caller.

  `Capability.getAllAvailable` and `Plugin.activateIfAvailable` are new: they read the app's
  contributions where they exist and return nothing where they do not, declaring no requirement. This
  is what lets `addType` fire `SpaceEvents.TypeAdded` and its `OnTypeAdded` callbacks in the app while
  still running on a host that has neither. Two
  capabilities moved onto the plugin-space verbs with the operations: `queryObjects` gained `in` (scope
  results to objects reachable from the given ones — how queue-backed mail is addressed), and
  `getObject` became `getObjects`, taking an array so a batch of references resolves in one call.

  The `discord` and `linear` skills are removed. Both advertised a tool whose handler set was
  registered nowhere, so invoking either failed at runtime; plugin-discord and plugin-linear already
  own connector-based sync for those services.

  Skill definitions are the atomic unit of MCP projection. A skill's `tools` list decides which
  operations project as MCP tools, and the load-the-skill-first pointer in each tool's description
  derives from that membership (the SEP-2640 shape). **`Operation.mcpTool` is removed** — with
  inclusion decided by skills and safety carried by `Operation.mutation`, nothing was left that the
  operation's own meta could not say: a tool's name is the key's final segment and its description is
  the operation's `description`. The three surviving overrides moved into meta, and
  `ProjectOperation.Create`'s key becomes `projectCreate` (its final segment was a too-generic
  `create`, and the key is now what names the tool). Folding those descriptions into meta also puts
  them in front of the in-app assistant, which never saw the MCP-only text.
  `DatabaseSkill` and `CodeProjectSkill` opt in with `mcpPrompt: true` and list their verbs
  (`CodeProjectSkill` now exports `operations`, spanning the project, task, milestone and outline
  verbs).

  Safety generalized into operation meta: the new `Operation.mutation('none' | 'write' |
'destructive')` annotation classifies an operation's effect on state — side-effect free, mutating
  but recoverable, or irreversible — as a fact about the operation rather than MCP projection
  config. The MCP server maps it to `readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint` exactly as `safety` did, and
  now also maps the existing `Operation.idempotent` annotation to `idempotentHint`. An unclassified
  operation emits no hints, which clients treat as possibly-destructive.

  The space operations are one namespace: `SpaceObjectOperation`'s verbs (`getObjects`,
  `queryObjects`, `queryTypes`, `updateObject`, `addTag`, `removeTag`) move into `SpaceOperation`, and
  the `@dxos/plugin-space/SpaceObjectOperation` subpath is removed — import them from
  `@dxos/plugin-space/SpaceOperation`. `addType` and `addRelation` also drop their `db` input: the
  database comes from `Database.Service`, which callers key with `{ spaceId }` in the invoke options.

  `addObject`, `addRelation` and `addType` now declare `Database.Service` as a required service, and
  the MCP projection keys the ambient `spaceId` tool parameter off that declaration — only
  space-addressed tools advertise it (`removeObjects` takes its space from the entities or
  space-qualified refs it is given, so it declares nothing and carries no parameter). Resolution is
  strict: the service materializes only from `InvokeOptions.spaceId` (or the parent process's
  environment for nested invocations), so every call site that needs the database passes
  `{ spaceId: db.spaceId }` in options — the create-object entries across the plugins included.

  `@dxos/app-toolkit` gains `NavigationResolver.forType(type, { getPath, getLabel?, position?, pages? })`
  — the whole body of the common custom-section navigation resolver (load the queried object, check it
  is an instance of the type, answer the section's path for it), so contributing one is a one-call
  module. Sections built with `TypeSection.createTypeSectionExtension` still need no resolver at all:
  their url binding ends in the typename, which plugin-space's generic lookup already reads.
  plugin-studio and plugin-inbox now use the helper, and the custom-shaped sections that were missing
  a resolver gained one through it — plugin-blogger (Publication), plugin-code (CodeProject) and
  plugin-commerce (Provider) — so their objects resolve to their sections instead of only the generic
  database path.

  Each plugin exposes one operation handler set, on the subpath convention. `@dxos/plugin-space`'s
  `./operations` subpath is replaced by `./SpaceOperationHandlerSet`, whose single `handlers` set
  carries every space operation — the separate curated "serializable" subset is gone, because the
  constraint that forced it is: the new `Operation.serializable(operations)` serializes a handler
  list tolerantly, dropping (with a warning) the few operations whose input schemas cannot render as
  JSON, so a registry can be fed the full set without an `ImportSpace`-style schema failing the whole
  registration.

  `@dxos/mcp-server`'s two namespaces are renamed. `Gateway` becomes **`McpRegistry`** — "gateway"
  reads as an MCP proxy fronting other servers, which is the opposite of what it is: the host's link
  to its operation registry, which a host implements (`/McpRegistry`). `Server` becomes `McpServer`,
  and it absorbs the skill-backed surface: `McpServer.fromSkills({ skills })` yields the projected MCP surface (prompts, tools,
  `skillLoad`) requiring only `Operation.Service`, beside `McpServer.layer` for a host reading a
  registry through `Gateway`. The name deliberately shadows effect's `McpServer` because it wraps
  it — `toolkit` and `layerStdio` are re-exported, so a host needs one import rather than two under
  different names. The package exports `/Gateway` and `/McpServer`, each with a build entry so the
  published package can resolve them. `Gateway.SkillRecord` carries `tools`.

  Fixed in `@dxos/echo` along the way: a struct with an open rest signature (`Schema.StructWithRest`)
  now survives the JSON Schema round-trip. Effect 4 omits `additionalProperties` when the rest
  signature's value type is unconstrained, and the serializer only restored it for bare records — so
  the decoder rebuilt the struct closed and `addObject`'s draft silently dropped every field beyond
  `@type`. The restore now applies whenever the key is absent, which is unambiguous: a closed struct
  always carries `additionalProperties: false` explicitly.

  `addObject` persists a described object rather than only referencing it. A draft is instantiated detached and `CollectionModel.add` files it by pushing a ref — on the branch that mints a root collection for a space that has none, nothing added the object to the database, so the ref dangled: the call returned an id whose object could not be read back, and nothing replicated. Only the remote path was reachable, since in-process callers pass a live object that is already in a database.

  A database is no longer an operation input. `SpaceOperation.AddObject` and `InboxOperation.AddMailbox` take `target` as an optional _collection_ — absent means the space root — and resolve the database from the invocation's space id instead. A database is an in-process handle that cannot cross an RPC boundary, so accepting one in an input schema only ever worked for in-process callers; naming the space is the form that works for both. Call sites that passed `target: db` drop it (most already passed the matching `spaceId`), and the handlers lose the `Effect.provide(Database.layer(db))` they needed to reconcile an input database against the declared service.

- 79d5ecf: Project host discovery as operations: `queryPlugins` (plugin-registry, on a new Registry skill), and `queryTypes` now reports each type's version and covers the host registry as well as the space. Invoking an operation that needs no space no longer fails on a session with no spaces. **Breaking:** `invokeOperation` no longer falls back to the session's first space — a space comes only from the call's `spaceId`, an operation's own `spaceId` field, or a space-qualified reference in its arguments, and an operation that acts on a space is refused when the call names none. `McpServer.resolveSpaceId` takes a `{ required }` option accordingly.
