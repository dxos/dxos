      text: "subspace.ai - PKM + REPL + AI \n The long-term goal of subspace is to be/have three things: \n \n PKM (Personal Knowledge Management system) like Roam Research or Tana. \n REPL-like (Read Evaluate Print Loop) capabilities. Should be able to execute individual code cells in the JVM backend and rendered in the frontend with Electric. Similar behaviour can be achieved with other languages via Jupyter kernels (or GraalVM Polyglot) and JavaScript. \n AI (Artificial Intelligence) integrations. Should be integrated with LLMs - e.g. write GPT queries in subspace, and incorporate the response to your personal knowledge base as a new node. Intelligent search and LLM-based summaries and reasoning over the existing knowledge base (Retrieval Oriented Generation, RAG). \n \n The overall design should be open-ended, allowing for easy forking and providing custom node types / rendering functions. The goal is not to be just a storage of information, but a control panel for commonly used workflows. So that you can create convenient shortcuts and informative output views with Clojure + Electric. Since you persist which actions you took over time, you can search for past outputs and interleave these with your personal notes. Later query your knowledge base with RAG in natural language, or query it with GPT by exposing subspace knowledge base as an API to GPT. \n For example, additional customizations and use cases could be: \n \n Intelligent work log for day to day coding. \n Wrappers for any babashka / shell scripts you already have. \n Wrapper functions to MLOps platform (or some other task manager) to trigger jobs, query stats and logs from past train runs. Build dashboards as subspace nodes from the result of such queries with Electric+HTML. \n Wrappers for common Kubernetes / AWS / GCP commands. Build ad hoc UIs on top of your cluster that make sense to you. \n Wrappers that pull the contents of arxiv documents as subspace nodes. \n Spaced repetition learning of content (of nodes which you mark to be remembered). \n \n UI/UX \n There will be two types of UI elements: pages and nodes. Pages contain nodes, and nodes can nest other nodes. Both pages and nodes are referencable (meaning you can link to them and the page/node will get a backreference). \n Each node contains some media, and possibly subnodes. \n Media can be: \n \n Text, numeric, Markdown \n Image, video, audio \n Flexible spreadsheet tesserrae \n code block, which can be executed in a jupyter kernel (runs once) \n code block containing an e/fn (runs continuously when on the page) \n \n Executing an e/fn is the most powerful and flexible thing to do. It can pull data in from other nodes on the page or in the graph, and displays its own little UI within its boundaries. Crucially, when upstream info changes, your e/fn's output gets recomputed. Running tesserrae is also very powerful; you can think of subspace as a non-grid tesserae that can also embed tesserae. \n Subnodes can be organised either by indenting or tiling. \n \n Indente",

Its main features include: \n \n powerful multi-modal search across ideas \n sharing microverses of knowledge with peers \n ranking items by Anki-like activation, so as to promote serendipity \n \n Installation \n Docker \n After installing docker and docker-compose, run: \n # install with:\ncurl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulbricman/conceptarium/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml\nmkdir knowledge\ndocker-compose up -d\n# stop with:\ndocker-compose stop\n# update with:\ndocker-compose stop\ndocker-compose rm -f\ndocker-compose pull\ndocker-compose up -d\n \n Note that you'll have to wait a bit initially for the models to be downloaded in the docker container. Use docker logs &lt;backend container ID&gt; or watch the process's memory for feedback on that. Or just try using it until it via the API or UI until it works (see usage). \n Source \n After pulling this repo run: \n python3 -m pip install -r frontend/requirements.txt\npython3 -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt\nstreamlit run frontend/main.py\n# in a separate session:\ncd backend\npython3 -m uvicorn main:app --reload\n# update by pulling from repo again\n \n Missing dependencies? Please have a look at frontend/Dockerfile and backend/Dockerfile. ARM architecture (e.g. Raspberry Pi)? Remove the torch entries from requirements.txt, and install a custom-built version. \n Usage \n The web app should then be available at localhost:8501, while the API at localhost:8000 (with docs at localhost:8000/docs). The backend component takes a few minutes to get the ML models at first. \n To access your local instance, enter the conceptarium URL (i.e. localhost:8000 if you ran from source, backend.docker:8000 if you used docker), and your desired token. Remember your token, as you'll have to use it to authenticate in future sessions. \n",

Our team is shipping very quickly right now so sharing ❤️feedback❤️ with us will really help shape the product 🚀 \n \n About \n Reor is an AI-powered desktop note-taking app: it automatically links related notes, answers questions on your notes and provides semantic search. Everything is stored locally and you can edit your notes with an Obsidian-like markdown editor. \n The hypothesis of the project is that AI tools for thought should run models locally by default. Reor stands on the shoulders of the giants Ollama, Transformers.js &amp; LanceDB to enable both LLMs and embedding models to run locally: \n \n Every note you write is chunked and embedded into an internal vector database. \n Related notes are connected automatically via vector similarity. \n LLM-powered Q&amp;A does RAG on your corpus of notes. \n Everything can be searched semantically. \n \n One way to think about Reor is as a RAG app with two generators: the LLM and the human. In Q&amp;A mode, the LLM is fed retrieved context from the corpus to help answer a query. Similarly, in editor mode, the human can toggle the sidebar to reveal related notes "retrieved" from the corpus. This is quite a powerful way of "augmenting" your thoughts by cross-referencing ideas in a current note against related ideas from your corpus. \n Getting Started \n \n Download from reorproject.org or releases. Mac, Linux &amp; Windows are all supported. \n Install like a normal App. \n \n Running local models \n Reor interacts directly with Ollama which means you can download and run models locally right from inside Reor. Head to Settings-&gt;Add New Local LLM then enter the name of the model you want Reor to download. You can find available models here. \n You can also connect to an OpenAI-compatible API like Oobabooga, Ollama or OpenAI itself! \n Importing notes from other apps \n Reor works within a single directory in the filesystem. You choose the directory on first boot.\nTo import notes/files from another app, you\'ll need to populate that directory manually with markdown files. Note that if you have frontmatter in your markdown files it may not parse correctly. Integrations with other apps are hopefully coming soon! \n Building from source \n Make sure you have nodejs installed. \n Clone repo \n git clone https://github.com/reorproject/reor.git\n \n Install dependencies \n Run for dev \n Build \n Interested in contributing? \n We are always on the lookout for contributors keen on building the future of knowledge management. Have a feature idea? Want to squash a bug? Want to improve some styling? We\'d love to hear it. Check out our issues page and the contributing guide to get started. \n License \n AGPL-3.0 license. See LICENSE for details. \n Reor means "to think" in Latin. \n',
