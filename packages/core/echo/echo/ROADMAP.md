## Issues

- [ ] Build error when changing from TypedObject using Ref$: Type 'Task' does not satisfy the constraint 'WithId' (see echo-schema/testing/schema.ts)
- [ ] Remove TypedObject? Currently second arg is options but these are not available in the pipe(EchoObject) althernative?
- [ ] What is the pipe alternative for TypedRelation?
- [ ] Reconcile all schema variants (Base, Immutable, TypedObject, EchoObject, etc.)
- [ ] Consolidate getters (getType, getSchema, getTypename, getSchemaTypename, etc.)
- [ ] ReactiveObject should specify id property? Reconcile BaseObject, ReactiveObject, HasId, WithId, etc.
- [ ] Can we us S.is(MyType) to detect objects with our types system? (Branding?)
