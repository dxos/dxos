FastGPT allows commercial usage, such as serving as a backend service for other applications or as an application development platform for enterprises. However, when it comes to multi-tenant SaaS services or matters involving the LOGO and copyright information, you must contact the author to obtain a commercial license. FastGPT supports importing documents in various formats, including Word, PDF, Excel, Markdown, and web links. It also enables syncing data from an entire website, automatically handling text preprocessing, vectorization, and QA splitting, which saves manual training time and improves efficiency. As long as the API of the model you want to integrate aligns with the official OpenAI API, it can be used with FastGPT. You can utilize projects like One API to unify access to different models and provide an API that is compatible with the official OpenAI API. If you come across any problems while using FastGPT, please join our community or forum, create a post, and reach out to us for assistance.',

      text: "\n \n \n \n \n At Helpjuice / \n \n #Software &amp; Alternatives\n May 15 2025 \n 11m read \n \n \n \n \n On the hunt for the perfect knowledge base software that’s open source? This post will walk you through the best options for your business. \n \n \n \n \n There’s no denying that a knowledge base can make a major impact on your organization.  Whether it's to help provide better support to your customers or to enable your employees to find the information they need to do their job, a finely-tuned knowledge base can make all the difference when it comes to how knowledge and information flows through your business. And with plenty of options on the market out there, there’s certainly no shortage of open source knowledge base software. But how can you tell you’re not investing time into installing and learning new software that your team won't use anyway? How can you avoid the time and effort put into an open source option that you later determine to not be a good fit for your needs?  It’s simple—do a little research beforehand. We know, we know—you don’t have endless time to invest in that kind of thing (what with a business to run and all). That’s why we’ve created a helpful list of the must-consider open source knowledge base software that companies of all niches, industries, and sizes should consider.  We’re even throwing in a little helpful knowledge that should equip you with the information needed to choose the right software for you—like what knowledge base software is in the first place, the benefits of open source software, and how to address your unique needs as a company to choose the right software for you.  Want to skip ahead on some of the basics of open-source knowledge base software?  Be our guest.  The best open source knowledge base software includes: \n BookStack \n OpenKM \n myBase \n eXo \n PHPKB \n Documize \n DocuWiki \n phpMyFAQ \n MediaWiki \n xWiki \n TWiki \n TiddlyWiki \n What is an Open Source Knowledge Base? Before we dive into which open-source knowledge base software you should consider for your business, we should probably ensure we’re on the same page about what exactly open-source knowledge base software is.  First things first, let’s start with the term knowledge base. A knowledge base is a central place that allows structured storage of information where users can search for and access this information.  Knowledge base software should be the key tool that helps make this process seamless, simplified, and efficient. Knowledge base software is designed to help you create and manage your knowledge base to the best of your ability. this usually includes setting up the knowledge base architecture, creating and editing documentation, searching, and analyzing your knowledge base, and more. Ideally, this is the irreplaceable piece of the puzzle that operates your entire knowledge management system that helps orchestrate, manage, and optimize the flow of knowledge within your organization.  That part seems pretty clear, right? Next, we’ll move on to",
