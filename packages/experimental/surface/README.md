# Surface Framework

# Zhenya's notes
- strongly typed actions (AppAction)
- actions by key instead of switch
- back out of "router adapter"
- extra key name mapping in Plugin.components and AppContextType.plugins
- plugin.deps?
- graph? nodes?
- not git scenarios at the top?

- route mapping? a way of changing nav state without calling navigate / route sets the app state (may incl. async loading)
- config of surfaces (?) / what component of what plugin should be rendered (overall at the app level?) / and how does plugin get state? stack plugin needs to know what object of what space is being rendered.
- what do plugins have in common? what contract? such that stacks can embed other plugins?
