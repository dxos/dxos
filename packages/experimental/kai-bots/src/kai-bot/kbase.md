# KBase (Braneframe)

## Summary

- Computable knowledge.
- Knowledge model DSL that describes data ontology AND how to find out that information.
- KBase is constantly in flux: edited by humans (owners, assistants, and service providers) and bots (service providers).
- First order DSL describes how to construct ontologies. But the constructed ontology is itself a computable DSL!
- The ontology describes entity schema, relationships, and processes that can be "run" to discover the answer (e.g., chat GTP question).
- The ontology is "computable"
- Creates a feedback loop that is scored by the consumer (this data is good, that's a bad question, etc.)
- Data becomes its own context for computation. More accurately it's the bridge between human and the machine (since the ontology is human readable/comprehensible).
- Stacks represent reified schema that has been computed. They maintain a "memory" of the computation.

- TODO(burdon): Explore analogy with GraphQL resolvers.

- TODO(burdon): Create demo.
- TODO(burdon): Create deck.
- TODO(burdon): Information theory.
