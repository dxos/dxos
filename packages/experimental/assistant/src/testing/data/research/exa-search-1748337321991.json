      "text": "In Personal AI, version control for memory and model is managed through a systematic approach that allows users to track, manage, and revert changes made to the AI's memory and model. ‚Äç Memory Stack: When you store a memory in Personal AI, it goes into the memory stack for training the AI. ‚Äç Data Uploads: Users can add, edit, or reinforce memories by uploading authored data directly into their personal language model. ‚Äç The personal language model has unlimited memory and is not bound by token or context limitations. The AI's performance is as good as the memory provided to it. If it makes false statements, the memory needs to be fixed and reinforced for future learning. There will be mechanisms to download the memory and model in the future. The output of the personal AI model is entirely controlled by the user's input and training. Yes, you can automate conversations using stacked memories in your Personal AI. By leveraging the memory stacking feature, you can train your AI to recall and utilize specific information during interactions ‚Äç Practices for Automating Conversations: Memory Anchors: When stacking new memories, consider adding memory anchors to organize the information effectively. This practice helps structure and categorize the data within your Personal AI account. Variety of Sources: Utilize all available tools such as the chat box, document editor, file uploader, and URL uploader to stack data from various sources. This diverse input enables your AI to learn from a wide range of inputs for a more personalized experience. ‚Äç Application of Practices: To automate conversations effectively, ensure that you consistently add relevant information into your memory stack using different tools provided by Personal AI. By doing so, you enable your AI to access and utilize this knowledge when engaging in digital interactions on your behalf. Yes, you can absolutely use hashtags to label and recall specific memories later on with your Personal AI. When adding memories to your AI, it's beneficial to include detailed and descriptive information about the topic or subject, along with context such as people, location, and absolute time for the AI to reference. Using hashtags allows you to categorize and organize these memories effectively. By using proper placement of hashtags without spaces and maintaining uniform capitalization, you can enhance the selection of memories for generating answers. Additionally, when stacking content using the chat box or file/document uploader in Personal AI, you can utilize #hashtags for single words or :colons followed by keywords for multiple words or complete titles. This practice helps in refining the selection of memories for generating answers while ensuring effective organization and retrieval of data. Personal AI is built with a strong emphasis on data privacy and security. It operates under the principle that the data you provide is yours alone.
