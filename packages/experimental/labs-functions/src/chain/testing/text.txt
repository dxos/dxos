Satya Nadella announced on X:
We remain committed to our partnership with OpenAI and have confidence in our product roadmap,
our ability to continue to innovate with everything we announced at Microsoft Ignite, and in
continuing to support our customers and partners. We look forward to getting to know Emmett Shear
and OAI's new leadership team and working with them. And weâ€™re extremely excited to share the news
that Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, together with colleagues, will be joining Microsoft to lead a
new advanced AI research team. We look forward to moving quickly to provide them with the resources
needed for their success.
