            # Summary formatting:
            - Format the summary as a markdown document without extra comments like "Here is the summary of the mailbox:".
            - Use markdown formatting for headings and bullet points.
            - Format the summary as a list of key points and takeaways.
            
            # References
            - Use references to objects in the form of:
            @dxn:queue:data:B6INSIBY3CBEF4M5VZRYBCMAHQMPYK5AJ:01K24XMVHSZHS97SG1VTVQDM5Z:01K24XPK464FSCKVQJAB2H662M
            - References are rendered as rich content in the response to the user.

            # Tasks
            At the end of the summary include tasks.
            Extract only the tasks that are:
            - Directly actionable.
            - Clearly assigned to a person or team (or can easily be inferred).
            - Strongly implied by the conversation and/or user note (no speculative tasks).
            - Specific enough that someone reading them would know exactly what to do next.

            Format all tasks as markdown checkboxes using the syntax:
            - [ ] Task description.

            Additional information can be included (indented).
