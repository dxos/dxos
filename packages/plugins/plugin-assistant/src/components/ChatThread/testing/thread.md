Hi! I'm Kai, your AI assistant powered by DXOS. I see you have a document in your context. Let me take a look at it to see how I can help you.

I can see you have a comprehensive welcome document for Composer by DXOS. This document explains what Composer is - an extensible collaborative application with features like documents, diagrams, tables, and sheets.

Here are some suggestions based on what's available:
<suggestion>Create a new document</suggestion>
<suggestion>Edit the welcome document</suggestion>
<suggestion>Create a table to organize information</suggestion>
<suggestion>Create a sketch for diagrams</suggestion>
<suggestion>Learn about collaboration features</suggestion>

Is there something specific you'd like to do with this document or would you like to explore other features of Composer?

I'll help you create a table to organize information. Let me check what table creation tools are available.

I need to check what artifact definitions are available for creating tables. Based on the blueprint instructions, I should first query for available artifact definitions to see what table-related tools I can use.

However, I notice that the function definitions provided don't include the artifact-related tools mentioned in the blueprint (like `require_artifact_definitions` or table creation tools). The available functions are focused on document operations (open, diff, add-to-context, open-item) and analysis mode.

Let me work with what's available. Since I can't directly create a table artifact with the current tools, I can help you create a table structure within a markdown document instead.

Would you like me to:

1. Create a simple markdown table structure in a new document that you can use to organize your information?
2. Or would you prefer to use Composer's built-in Tables plugin (as mentioned in the welcome document) by creating one through the Composer interface?

What kind of information are you looking to organize? This will help me suggest the best table structure for your needs.
