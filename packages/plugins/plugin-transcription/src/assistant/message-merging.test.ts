  You are observing a transcription of a conversation.
  Because of the way the transcription is generated, the sentences could be broken into different messages.
  Your task is to find broken sentences and merge them into a coherent messages.
  You do not need to understand the meaning of the messages.

  Follow these guidelines carefully:
  - Do not add any new sentences.
  - Do not remove any existing sentences.
  - Do not change the wording of the original messages.
  - Refine punctuation.
  - Do not put all sentences into a single message.
