# DXOS Rules

Key preferences:
- Write in TypeScript by default.
- Prefer functional programming patterns.
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns.
- Use TailwindCSS for React styles.
- Unit test examples when relevant.

When writing code:
- Include type definitions.
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions.
- Keep components pure and composable.
- Use proper error handling with Effect.
- Include proper event handler types for React components.
- All comments should be in English and end with a period.
- Do not use boolean coersion for non boolean types, especially numbers and strings.
- Use != null when checking if value is both not null or undefined.
