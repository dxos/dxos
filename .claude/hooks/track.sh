# UserPromptSubmit hook for the task-planning sentinels.
#
# 1. `$track <text>` (anywhere) or a line beginning `track: <text>` — record <text>
#    as a follow-up in the active TASKS.md (see the task-planning skill).
# 2. `$hydrate` / `$checkpoint` — checkpoint the current project (reconcile TASKS.md,
#    refresh the registry resume pointer, account for uncommitted work).
# 3. `$resume [name]` / `$rehydrate` — reload a project (from the registry) and report.
# 4. `$project [new|list|end …]` — manage the project registry; bare `$project`
#    (or `list`) prints a numbered table you resume from by replying with a row number.
# Stateless: emits one directive per matching sentinel and nothing otherwise.
