# NEW FORCES CHALLENGING TECH MONOPOLIES

We are at a pivotal juncture in the history of the internet.
<br/>
What was intended to be a public commons has been captured by global monopolies that answer to no one.
<br/>
<br/>
Today, three convergent forces make change possible.


## Technology

Methods used for managing distributed assets in the cloud are evolving into fully decentralized technologies that eliminate the need for centralized authority altogether. The technical rationales for centralized authority over user identity, user data, and computing are all rapidly eroding.


## Social push-back

The cloud-based software industry obeys strong economic incentives to capture users and their data as corporate assets to be locked-in and monetized. Many are seeking alternatives to this model, and even mainstream audiences are growing in antipathy toward tech monopoly, adtech, surveillance, and censorship.


## A new economy

Blockchain technologies have unlocked new models of ownership, organization, and governance. Liberated from the centralized and proprietary norms that have long dominated the software industry, developer-entrepreneurs can work for both economic reward and the common good.
