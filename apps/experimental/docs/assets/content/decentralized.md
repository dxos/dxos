# Decentralized Data

##

To date, most decentralized systems have focused on ledger and content replication protocols. 
But most real-world applications require realtime structured data 
using object and relational databases that operate at internet scale.

Most technological development to date has focused on decentralized ledgers that enable global consensus over immutable datasets. Common use cases for these systems involve financial transactions and other Defi applications.

#### Ethereum, Polkadot, Dfinity

### CONTENT-ADDRESSABLE STORAGE

Content-addressable storage systems enable the distribution of large immutable datasets. 
Use cases for these systems typically involve storing and sharing files and messages (e.g., music, images, documents, and source code).

#### IPFS, Storj, Sia, Bittorrent

### REALTIME STRUCTURED DATA

Realtime structured data presents unique challenges for decentralization in terms of scale, latency, and consistency. 
However, all SaaS applications running on centralized cloud systems have these fundamental requirements.
