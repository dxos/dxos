# A New Stack

DXOS provides the first Minimally Viable Platform for decentralized applications that require realtime structured data.


## Applications

Applications and services share common data structures and are intrinsically interoperable. DXOS supports the development of rich fullstack applications that consist of both user-facing and backend components.

## Protocols

Core protocols provide for real time synchronized data, identity and secrets management, and peer-to-peer networking. These enable applications to securely query and subscribe to data across the network, and for users to control how their data is shared.

## Network

A peer-to-peer network of virtual machines provides compute, storage, networking, and other runtime infrastructure services. This DXOS P2P network consists of software components and protocols (MESH) and a physical network of low-cost devices. 

## Blockchain
 
The foundation of the system is a permissionless blockchain that provides a censorship-resistant registry of applications and services. Asset registration, economic exchange, reputation, and governance are coordinated without any central authority.
