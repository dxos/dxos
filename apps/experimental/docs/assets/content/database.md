## Secure, scalable, and high-performance realtime data

DXOS incorporates a unique internet-scale graph database that supports indexed queries and subscriptions, 
structured data, and powerful data consistency algorithms that enable realtime applications and collaboration. This combines the power of cloud-based databases with the privacy and resilience of peer-to-peer networks.

## Designed for developer productivity

The DXOS platform provides a comprehensive set of APIs and tools that are as simple to use as existing Web frameworks. 
This can enable hundreds of thousands of developers to build full stack Web3 apps without prior knowledge of crypto or decentralized technologies.
