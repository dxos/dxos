# TEST

Your mission is to create the first functionally and commercially competitive, 
fully decentralized alternative to the public cloud.

## Compete with the Cloud

It is not enough to protest extreme centralization; what matters is to replace it with a user-sovereign, privacy-preserving alternative. This alternative must enable applications that can compete with the cloud-based incumbents that dominate the application landscape.


## Build New Kinds of Applications

DXOS enables the development of entirely new classes of decentralized applications. It is a network operating system, infrastructure platform, programming framework, and toolchainâ€”providing a complete development solution that rivals conventional cloud platforms. 


## Protect Privacy and Data Sovereignty

Data sovereignty and privacy are enforced at the protocol level by a uniquely scalable decentralized database. Unlike conventional approaches, data is not held captive by applications. Instead, individuals and teams are able to select and change which applications have access to their data.
