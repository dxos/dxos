The MESH protocol extends existing internet protocols to enable secure and resilient peer-to-peer networks. 
MESH enables the development of privacy-preserving applications that operate without centralized infrastructure.


## DXOS Platform

A peer-to-peer service network that supports decentralized applications and services
without dependencies on centralized infrastructure. 

### DXNS

The Decentralized Naming Service (DXNS) is a permissionless blockchain that is used to coordinate and control the network.
DXNS is a global registry for applications, services, network devices, and other platform assets.


### KUBE
