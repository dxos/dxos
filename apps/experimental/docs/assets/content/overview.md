# The Decentralized Operating System

DXOS is a network operating system, infrastructure platform, programming framework, 
and toolchainâ€”providing a complete solution that rivals conventional cloud platforms.

## Preserving privacy

DXOS is a user-sovereign, privacy-preserving alternative to the public cloud.
Users maintain complete control over their data and identity.
It incorporates new L2 protocols for user identity, peer-to-peer networking, and secure realtime data.


## Unlocking your data

DXOS incorporates an internet-scale network database
that enables realtime structured data.
Individuals and teams can select and change which applications have access to their data.
This <b>inversion of control</b> gives rise to intrinsically interoperable applications.

## Empowering Developers

DXOS is built and operated by a global open source community.
Developers are free to launch without paying fees to rent-seeking monopolies.
This makes possible a new software economy that 
aligns the interests of developers, network operators, and users.
