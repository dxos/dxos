# Roadmap

## DXOS Framework and SDK

The DXOS stack is a continually evolving set of protocols, components.
The initial open source rollout will enable developers to create and operate applications and to
evaluate the technologies, and contribute to the project.

### Advancing to the Next Phase

Once the network is running smoothly and has a sufficient number of well staked validators, we will enable Nominated Proof of Stake with a Sudo call.


## KUBE Network Beta

The beta program will enable developers to operate and manage decentralized applications on shared
infrastructure provided by DXOS, partner organizations, and developers themselves.


## DXOS Foundation

The DXOS Foundation will be an independent non-profit organization that oversees the development of the DXOS
network and supports the community.


## Testnet

The Testnet will implement a Nominated Proof of Stake mechanism where the network will run with a decentralized
set of validators.


## Payments

DXNS will implement a decentralized payments network enabling applications to execute secure transactions.
This will enable users to pay for applications and services.


## Governance

Once the network is live, it can continue to funciton without any involvement of the founding team or participants.
The DXNS permissionless blockchain ensures that applications and critical infrastructure can be used and maintained.
The blockchain itself will be governed by elected representatives who serve the community.
