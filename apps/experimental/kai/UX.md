# UX

Notes for our PWA app.

> TODO(burdon): Move to braneframe docs.

Applications can be deconstructed into the following aspects:

1. Shell (installable skeleton)
1. Containers (aka Frames)
1. Navigation (e.g., layout of containers)
1. Data (ECHO branes and spaces)
1. Access control (HALO circles)
1. Actions

## Containers

Containers are typically rectangular areas of a display that enable the user to interact with and manipulate data, and initiate actions.

### Generic containers

Generic containers may be configured to handle multiple kinds of data, e.g., from a query.

- List
- Grid
- Table
- Spreadsheet
- Kanban
- Form
- Masonry (i.e, various forms of tiling)
- Graph (e.g., force-directed, hierarchy, hyperbolic tree, 100+ D3 layouts)
- Browser
- Wiki
- Popovers
- Search (both search-as-you-type indicators, and results)
- Text documents (e.g., with embedded sections)
- Timeline
- VR/3D space

### App-specific containers

App-specific containers encode particular use cases.

- Map
- Calendar
- Address book
- Project management
- Messengers (e.g., Inbox, Chat)
- Diagram
- Charts (e.g., Gantt, data visualization)
- Terminal
- Video (e.g., Conferencing)
- Games
