 * A locking meachnism to ensure that a given section of the code is executed by only a single "thread" at a time.
 *
 * Functions are chained in a structure similar to a linked list. `_lastPromise` always contains the function
 * that will finish executing last. Initially it is set to `Promise.resolve()` - promise that resolves immediately.
 * Enqueing is done by attaching provided function to the `_lastPromise` via a `.then()` call and updating
 * the `_lastPromise` variable. It is important that enquing is done atomically: there are no `await`s in
 * `executeSynchronized` and it's not async while still returning a promise.

 * Java docs reference on synchronized sections:
 * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/locksync.html
