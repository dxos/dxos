# Spaces

::: info Spaces are collections of content that can be shared with others.
:::

## Details

Each object is always in exactly one space.

Spaces don't nest within each other, they're always top-level.

## Types

### Personal space

By default, each user has a personal space that contains all of their content. This space is private to the user and is not shared with anyone else. This space replicates to all of the user's devices.

### Shared spaces

Users can create shared spaces and invite others to join them. The data in a shared space is replicated across all of the devices of the users who have access to the space.

## Drag-and-drop

::: warning Technology Preview
Moving objects between spaces is a work in progress.
:::

Dragging and dropping a document from one space to another makes a copy in the second space. Copying of other object types is being implemented but shouldn't be relied on yet.
